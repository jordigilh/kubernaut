The codebase extensively implements a <10% workflow termination rate policy to ensure high system reliability and business continuity. This is a critical operational requirement that prevents excessive workflow failures from impacting business operations.

#### **Evidence from Business Logic**
```go
// pkg/workflow/engine/production_failure_handler.go:159-161
// BR-WF-541: Apply <10% termination rate policy
criticalFailureRate := float64(health.CriticalFailures) / float64(health.TotalSteps)
terminationThreshold := 0.10 // 10% threshold for BR-WF-541

// pkg/workflow/engine/resilient_workflow_engine.go:27
maxPartialFailures: 2, // BR-WF-541: <10% termination rate

// pkg/workflow/engine/resilient_interfaces.go:44
MaxPartialFailures: int `yaml:"max_partial_failures" default:"2"` // <10% termination rate
```

#### **Proposed Business Requirement**
