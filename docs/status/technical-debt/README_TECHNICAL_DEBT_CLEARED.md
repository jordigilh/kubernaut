## 🚀 Next Steps - Your Decision

**Option A: Infrastructure Setup** (Week 1-2)
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DB setup
- Kubernetes clusters (KIND for dev)

**Option B: CRD Controllers** (Week 2-6)
- 5 controllers (Remediation Orchestrator, Processor, AI Analysis, Workflow, Executor)

**Option C: HTTP Services** (Week 6-8)
- 6 services (Gateway, Data Storage, HolmesGPT API, Context API, Notification, Monitoring)

**Recommendation**: A → B → C (7-8 weeks to MVP)
