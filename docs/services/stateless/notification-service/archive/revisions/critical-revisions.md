# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: Critical Revisions Document

**Original Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Deprecation Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: üì¶ **ARCHIVED - CONTENT DISTRIBUTED**

## üîÑ Content Has Been Distributed

This document contained two critical architectural decisions that have been **extracted and distributed** to appropriate locations for better discoverability and maintenance:

---

### **CRITICAL-1: RBAC Permission Filtering ‚Üí ADR-014**

**Original Content**: Lines 8-176 (RBAC architectural mistake and correction)

**Now Located At**:  
üìÑ **[ADR-014: Notification Service Uses External Service Authentication](../../../../architecture/decisions/ADR-014-notification-service-external-auth.md)**

**Summary**: 
- ‚ùå **Removed**: RBAC pre-filtering of notification actions (~500 lines of code)
- ‚úÖ **Added**: External service authentication delegation
- **Impact**: 50ms faster notifications, simpler architecture, better separation of concerns

**Why Moved**: Major architectural decisions should be documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for visibility and traceability.

---

### **CRITICAL-3: Secret Mounting Strategy ‚Üí Security Configuration**

**Original Content**: Lines 180-476 (Secret mounting options and deployment configuration)

**Now Located At**:  
üìÑ **[Security Configuration - Secret Management Strategy](../../security-configuration.md#secure-secret-management)**

**Summary**:
- ‚úÖ **V1 Decision**: Use Kubernetes Projected Volumes (Option 3) - Security Score 9.5/10
- ‚è≥ **V2 Migration**: Add External Secrets + Vault when centralized secret management needed
- **Impact**: Excellent security with zero external dependencies

**Why Moved**: Deployment and security decisions belong in service-specific security configuration documentation where operators expect to find them.

---

### **Design Evolution Summary ‚Üí Service Overview**

**Original Content**: Historical context of both critical decisions

**Now Located At**:  
üìÑ **[Notification Service Overview - Design Evolution](../../overview.md#design-evolution)**

**Summary**: Complete history of major architectural revisions with impact analysis and cross-references to detailed documentation.

**Why Moved**: Design evolution context helps future maintainers understand current architecture but doesn't need to be in a separate archive file.

## üìö Complete Distribution Map

| Original Section | Lines | New Location | Document Type |
|------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **CRITICAL-1: RBAC Removal** | 8-176 | [ADR-014](../../../../architecture/decisions/ADR-014-notification-service-external-auth.md) | Architecture Decision Record |
| **CRITICAL-3: Secret Mounting** | 180-476 | [security-configuration.md](../../security-configuration.md#secure-secret-management) | Service Security Documentation |
| **Summary & Impact** | Various | [overview.md](../../overview.md#design-evolution) | Service Overview |

## üéØ Why This Document Was Deprecated

### **Before (Archive)**
- Hidden in `archive/revisions/` directory (low discoverability)
- Single monolithic document (mixed concerns)
- Not following ADR pattern for architectural decisions
- Hard to find when searching for security or architecture docs

### **After (Distributed)**
- Architecture decisions in standard ADR location (`docs/architecture/decisions/`)
- Security configuration in service security docs (where operators expect it)
- Design history in service overview (appropriate context)
- Each concern in its proper location (single responsibility)

### **Benefits of Distribution**
‚úÖ **Improved Discoverability**: Architecture decisions visible in ADR directory  
‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Each concern in appropriate location  
‚úÖ **Follows Standards**: ADR pattern for architectural decisions  
‚úÖ **Operator-Friendly**: Security config where it's expected  
‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Easier to update individual concerns
