  previous_image: "app:v2.0.5"
  cve_analysis:
    current_vulnerabilities: ["CVE-2024-1234 (CRITICAL)", "CVE-2024-5678 (HIGH)"]
    previous_vulnerabilities: ["CVE-2023-9999 (MEDIUM)"]

action: "update_network_policy"
reasoning: "Network policy 'deny-all-egress' blocking legitimate traffic - propose temporary egress allowlist"
```

##### 3. **Pod Security with CVE Mitigation**
