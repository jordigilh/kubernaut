# Testing Status and Coverage

## Overview

This document reflects the current testing status of the Prometheus Alerts SLM system as of the latest cleanup and migration from testify to Ginkgo/Gomega.

## Unit Test Coverage by Package

### ✅ Well-Tested Packages
- **pkg/metrics**: 84.2% coverage - Comprehensive test suite covering metrics collection and reporting
- **pkg/webhook**: 78.2% coverage - Good coverage of webhook endpoints and handlers
- **internal/config**: 77.8% coverage - Configuration loading and validation tested
- **internal/validation**: 98.7% coverage - Excellent coverage of validation logic
- **internal/errors**: 97.0% coverage - Comprehensive error handling tests

### ⚠️ Partially Tested Packages
- **pkg/k8s**: 46.1% coverage - Basic Kubernetes client operations tested, advanced features need more coverage
- **pkg/executor**: 42.1% coverage - Core action execution tested, but many advanced actions lack coverage
- **internal/mcp**: 56.4% coverage - MCP server functionality partially tested (all tests passing)
- **internal/database**: 20.4% coverage - Basic database operations tested, complex scenarios need coverage

### ❌ Untested Packages (0% coverage)
- **pkg/processor**: No tests - Core alert processing logic needs test coverage
- **pkg/slm**: No tests - SLM client integration needs test coverage
- **pkg/notifications**: No tests - Notification system needs test coverage
- **pkg/types**: No tests - Type definitions and utilities need test coverage
- **cmd/** packages: No tests - Command-line interfaces need test coverage
- **internal/actionhistory**: No tests - Action history tracking needs test coverage
- **internal/oscillation**: No tests - Oscillation detection needs test coverage

## Integration Test Status

### ✅ Working Integration Tests
Integration tests are functional and execute real SLM analysis workflows, though some are failing:
- **Correlated Alerts Integration**: Tests multi-alert correlation scenarios
- **Confidence and Consistency Validation**: Tests SLM confidence calibration
- **Context Performance Tests**: Tests performance under various context sizes
- **Database Integration**: Tests MCP database integration scenarios

### ❌ Removed Integration Tests
The following integration test files were removed due to undefined dependencies or incomplete implementation:
- `advanced_scenarios_test.go` - Used undefined `OllamaIntegrationSuite`
- `end_to_end_test.go` - Used undefined `OllamaIntegrationSuite`
- All `*_ginkgo_test.go` files that used undefined variables like `testConfig`, `testEnv`

## Test Framework Migration Status

### ✅ Completed Migrations
- **pkg/executor**: Fully migrated from testify to Ginkgo/Gomega
- **pkg/processor**: Migrated to Ginkgo/Gomega (though no actual tests exist)
- **pkg/slm**: Cleaned up testify remnants, pure Ginkgo specs
- All unit test packages now use Ginkgo/Gomega exclusively

### ❌ No testify Usage Remaining
All testify imports and dependencies have been completely removed from the codebase.

## Critical Testing Gaps

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **SLM Client Integration** (`pkg/slm`): No tests for the core AI analysis functionality
2. **Alert Processing** (`pkg/processor`): No tests for the main alert processing pipeline
3. **Notification System** (`pkg/notifications`): No tests for alert notifications

### Medium Priority (Supporting Features)
1. **Action History** (`internal/actionhistory`): No tests for action tracking
2. **Oscillation Detection** (`internal/oscillation`): No tests for oscillation prevention
3. **Advanced K8s Actions**: Many executor actions lack specific test coverage

### Low Priority (Infrastructure)
1. **Command Line Tools**: CLI interfaces need basic functionality tests
2. **Type Definitions**: Basic type validation tests needed

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Missing Unit Tests
1. **pkg/slm**: Create tests for SLM client initialization, request/response handling, and error scenarios
2. **pkg/processor**: Test alert filtering, processing pipeline, and error handling
3. **pkg/notifications**: Test notification formatting, delivery, and failure handling
4. **internal/actionhistory**: Test action storage, retrieval, and correlation
5. **internal/oscillation**: Test oscillation detection algorithms and thresholds

### For Integration Tests
1. Add end-to-end integration tests that don't require external dependencies
2. Create performance benchmark tests for critical paths
3. Add error resilience tests for failure scenarios

### For Test Infrastructure
1. Consider adding test utilities for common mock setups
2. Add test data fixtures for consistent test scenarios
3. Implement test coverage enforcement in CI/CD pipeline

## Notes

- Integration tests require external dependencies (Ollama, PostgreSQL) and may be skipped in CI
- Some integration test failures are expected in environments without proper setup
- The test cleanup removed approximately 10 broken integration test files that were using undefined types
- All MCP unit tests have been fixed and are now passing (previously had 3 failing tests)
- Current test suite runs successfully without testify dependencies
