## 🎯 **BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FRAMEWORK**

### **Requirement Structure**
Each business requirement follows a standardized structure:

```markdown
### **BR-[AREA]-[NUMBER]: [Requirement Title]**
**File:** Location of stub implementation
**Method:** Specific method or function

**Business Requirement:** Clear statement of business need

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **[Category 1]** - Specific functional needs
2. **[Category 2]** - Additional functional needs
...

**Success Criteria:**
- Measurable performance benchmarks
- Accuracy and reliability requirements
- Business impact measurements

**Business Value:**
- Clear articulation of business benefit
- ROI considerations
- User experience improvements
```

### **Requirement Categories**
- **🔴 Critical:** Core functionality essential for business operations
- **🟡 High:** Important features that significantly enhance system capabilities
- **🟢 Medium:** Nice-to-have features that improve user experience

### **Testing Requirements**
Every business requirement includes:
- **Business Outcome Tests:** Validate actual business value
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Measurable performance criteria
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end scenario validation
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Stakeholder-verifiable success measures

---

## 📈 **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### **Business-First Development**
1. **Requirements Before Implementation**
   - All business requirements documented before coding begins
   - Clear success criteria defined and measurable
   - Business value articulated and validated

2. **Test-Driven Business Outcomes**
   - Tests validate business requirements, not implementation details
   - Real dependencies used where possible
   - Business stakeholders can understand test results

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Zero stub implementations in completed features
   - Business requirement tests must pass
   - Performance criteria must be met
   - Code review includes business value validation

### **Integration Standards**
1. **Consistency with Phase 1**
   - Reuse established shared types and error handling
   - Follow logging and monitoring patterns
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Integrate seamlessly with existing core functionality
   - Maintain separation of concerns
   - Follow established design patterns

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Business context for all technical decisions
   - Clear user impact statements
   - Troubleshooting and debugging guides
