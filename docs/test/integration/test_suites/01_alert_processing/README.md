# Alert Processing Test Suite

## ℹ️ TERMINOLOGY NOTE

This test suite uses "alert processing" terminology because it specifically tests **Prometheus alert** handling, which is one type of signal in Kubernaut's multi-signal architecture.

### **Context**

- **Specific Signal Type**: These tests validate Prometheus alert reception, validation, and processing
- **Business Requirements**: BR-PA-001 through BR-PA-005 (Prometheus Alert-specific requirements)
- **Terminology**: "Alert" is semantically correct here - it refers to the specific signal type

### **Multi-Signal Architecture**

Kubernaut supports multiple signal types:
- ✅ Prometheus Alerts (tested in this suite)
- ✅ Kubernetes Events
- ✅ AWS CloudWatch Alarms
- ✅ Custom Webhooks

For the broader signal processing architecture and naming conventions, see:
- [ADR-015: Alert to Signal Naming Migration](../../../../architecture/decisions/ADR-015-alert-to-signal-naming-migration.md)
- [V1 Source of Truth Hierarchy](../../../../V1_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_HIERARCHY.md)
