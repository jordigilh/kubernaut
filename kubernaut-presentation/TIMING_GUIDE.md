## Pacing Guidelines

### Fast Pace (Technical PMs)
- **Per slide:** 1-2 minutes
- **Style:** Crisp, data-driven, assume knowledge
- **Interaction:** Encourage questions during presentation

### Standard Pace (Mixed Audience)
- **Per slide:** 2-3 minutes
- **Style:** Clear explanations, define terms
- **Interaction:** Questions at end

### Current Target: **Fast Pace for Technical PMs**
- 12-15 slides in 15 minutes
- 2 minutes average per slide (some 30 sec, some 2+ min)
- Dense speaker notes for depth, concise slides for clarity

## Key Timing Rules

3. **Technical architecture:** 1-2 minutes (they'll ask questions)
4. **Business model:** 1-2 minutes (they understand OSS models)
5. **References:** 0 seconds (backup for Q&A)

- "This slide is a bit busy..." (then don't show it)
- "I know we're running short on time..." (you planned 15 min)
- "There's a lot here but..." (simplify the slide)
- "Sorry, let me skip this..." (remove it beforehand)

✅ **Always say:**
- "Let me show you why this matters..."
- "Here's the key insight..."
- "This is important because..."
- "We'll come back to this in Q&A..."
