## 🎯 **Impact: Before vs. After**

### **BEFORE (Without Market Data)**
❌ "Only 3 platforms do autonomous K8s remediation"
❌ No market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
❌ No trend validation
❌ Dynatrace mischaracterized as "assistive only"
❌ No source citations
❌ Claim: "Kubernaut is unique" (no market context)

### **AFTER (With Market Data)**
✅ "4 platforms do autonomous K8s remediation (Datadog, Dynatrace, Akuity, Kubernaut)"
✅ TAM: $12.7B global AIOps → $87.6B (2035)
✅ SAM: $3.7B North America K8s infrastructure
✅ SOM: $185-370M (Prometheus + autonomous segment)
✅ Trend validation: Autonomous agents = #1 AIOps trend
✅ Market concentration: 65% = top 5 vendors (validates open source need)
✅ All claims cited with [Source](URL) links
✅ Accurate: Dynatrace is major autonomous competitor
✅ Honest: All 3 competitors part of 65% vendor consolidation
✅ Credible: "Kubernaut targets $3.7B market with vendor-neutral option"
