### **üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING USER INPUT**

#### **Issue 1: 20B Model Infrastructure Decision (URGENT)**
**Status**: **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE USER DECISION**
**Impact**: BLOCKS enterprise production deployment

**Options:**
1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploy 20B model on cloud GPU instances (AWS/Azure/GCP)
   - **Pros**: Managed infrastructure, auto-scaling, high availability
   - **Cons**: Higher operational costs (~$200-500/month), network latency for on-premises K8s
   - **Requirements**: Cloud account setup, GPU instance provisioning

2. **On-Premises GPU Infrastructure**: Deploy on your existing hardware
   - **Pros**: Lower operational costs, network proximity to K8s clusters
   - **Cons**: Hardware requirements (8GB+ GPU memory), maintenance overhead
   - **Requirements**: GPU hardware verification, model deployment setup

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use current Ollama setup with infrastructure scaling
   - **Pros**: Leverages existing setup, gradual scaling
   - **Cons**: May need hardware upgrades for production scale
   - **Requirements**: Performance validation, scaling plan

**‚úÖ USER DECISIONS COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure approach**: On-premises GPU (current Ollama setup)
- ‚úÖ **GPU hardware capability**: Validated - Ollama at 192.168.1.169:8080 with 20B model support
- ‚úÖ **Target production scale**: 5 concurrent alerts maximum for current hardware
- ‚úÖ **Budget**: On-premises deployment, future Anthropic Claude-4-Sonnet testing after validation

#### **Issue 2: Model Performance SLA Definition (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Status**: **REQUIRES USER SPECIFICATION**

**‚úÖ USER DECISIONS COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Acceptable response time**: Current recommended settings (<30 seconds for 20B model analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Confidence threshold**: <0.8 triggers human escalation (recommended standard)
- ‚úÖ **Concurrent processing**: 5 alerts maximum for current hardware capacity

#### **Issue 3: Fallback Strategy for Model Unavailability (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status**: **REQUIRES POLICY DECISION**

**‚úÖ USER DECISIONS COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Fallback strategy**: Rule-based decisions when 20B model is unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Processing approach**: Process with lower confidence (do not queue alerts)
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring requirements**: Heartbeat monitoring with automatic configuration failover

**üîß IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Heartbeat monitoring system design and implementation needed
- Configuration failover mechanism for seamless fallback
- Rule-based processing engine with confidence scoring

### **Milestone 1 Reassessment Result**
