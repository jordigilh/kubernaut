# Relax PDB Workflow Schema - Job Backend (BR-WORKFLOW-004)
# Scenario: #124 -- PDB deadlock -> temporarily relax PDB
metadata:
  workflowId: relax-pdb-v1
  version: "1.0.0"
  description:
    what: "Temporarily relaxes a PodDisruptionBudget by reducing minAvailable to allow voluntary disruptions to proceed"
    whenToUse: "When a PDB is blocking rolling updates or node drains because minAvailable equals the replica count, leaving zero allowed disruptions"
    whenNotToUse: "When pods are genuinely unhealthy and the PDB is correctly protecting against further disruption during an outage"
    preconditions: "All pods matching the PDB selector are healthy, and the blocking is caused by an overly conservative minAvailable setting rather than actual instability"
