# ADR-014: Notification Service Uses External Service Authentication

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Related**: [Notification Service Overview](../../services/stateless/notification-service/overview.md), BR-NOT-037

---

## Context

During initial design of the Notification Service, we considered implementing RBAC permission filtering to pre-filter notification action buttons based on each recipient's actual permissions in external services (GitHub, Kubernetes, Grafana, etc.).

The original approach required:
- Mapping email recipients to Kubernetes users/ServiceAccounts
- Querying Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview API for K8s permissions
- Querying Git provider APIs for repository permissions
- Permission caching with TTL-based invalidation
- Complex recipient mapping configuration

This added significant complexity (~500 lines of code) and tight coupling between Kubernaut and external services.

### Original Requirement (BR-NOT-037 - Incorrect)

> "Notification Service MUST filter action buttons based on recipient's actual permissions (RBAC) to prevent showing actions the recipient cannot perform."

### Problem Identified

**User Feedback**: 
> "Why is there a UI/UX requirement when there is no UI provided? Notifications should provide links to external services (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and those services should provide the authentication services, not Kubernaut."

**Assessment**: The feedback identified a major architectural misunderstanding. The original approach:
- ‚ùå **Unnecessary complexity** - External services already handle their own authentication
- ‚ùå **Wrong separation of concerns** - Authentication is the responsibility of the target service
- ‚ùå **Information hiding** - Pre-filtering prevents users from knowing actions exist
- ‚ùå **Tight coupling** - Kubernaut would need to understand multiple permission systems
- ‚ùå **Stale permissions** - Cached permissions could be outdated
- ‚ùå **External recipient failure** - No way to handle non-Kubernetes users (e.g., external vendors)

---

## Decision

**We will NOT implement RBAC permission filtering in the Notification Service.**

Instead, notifications will include **ALL recommended actions** as **links to external services**. When a user clicks a link:

1. User authenticates with the external service (GitHub, GitLab, Grafana, Kubernetes Dashboard, etc.)
2. External service enforces its own RBAC/permissions
3. User either:
   - Performs the action (if authorized)
   - Sees "Forbidden" or equivalent error from that service (if unauthorized)

### Revised Requirement (BR-NOT-037 - Correct)

> "Notification Service MUST include links to external services for all recommended actions. Authentication and authorization are enforced by the target service (GitHub, Grafana, Kubernetes API, etc.), not by Kubernaut."

---

## Example: Correct Notification Flow

### Email Notification (All Actions Visible)

```
Email to: developer@company.com

üö® Alert: Pod OOMKilled in production namespace

Recommended Actions:

1. üìä View Pod Logs
   ‚Üí https://grafana.company.com/logs?pod=webapp-abc123
   (Grafana handles authentication when clicked)

2. üìà View Prometheus Metrics
   ‚Üí https://prometheus.company.com/graph?query=container_memory_usage{pod="webapp-abc123"}
   (Prometheus handles authentication when clicked)

3. üîÑ Restart Pod
   ‚Üí https://k8s-dashboard.company.com/namespaces/production/pods/webapp-abc123/restart
   (Kubernetes Dashboard handles authentication when clicked)
   (If developer lacks permission, K8s Dashboard shows "Forbidden")

4. üìù Approve GitOps PR
   ‚Üí https://github.com/company/k8s-manifests/pull/123
   (GitHub handles authentication when clicked)
   (If developer lacks write permission, GitHub hides "Merge" button)
```

### Slack Notification (No RBAC Filtering)

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "üö® Alert: Pod OOMKilled - webapp"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": { "type": "plain_text", "text": "üìä View Logs" },
          "url": "https://grafana.company.com/logs?pod=webapp-abc123",
          "style": "primary"
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": { "type": "plain_text", "text": "üîÑ Restart Pod" },
          "url": "https://k8s-dashboard.company.com/pods/webapp-abc123/restart"
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": { "type": "plain_text", "text": "üìù Approve PR" },
          "url": "https://github.com/company/k8s-manifests/pull/123"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: All buttons are shown. Authentication and authorization happen at the external service when clicked.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Reduced Complexity** (~500 lines of code eliminated)
   - No RecipientMapper interface
   - No Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview checks
   - No Git provider permission checks
   - No permission caching logic
   - No recipient-to-user mapping configuration

2. **Faster Notifications** (~50ms lower latency)
   - No external API calls to check permissions
   - No cache lookups or cache invalidation
   - Direct notification delivery

3. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Kubernaut focuses on notification delivery
   - External services own their authentication/authorization
   - Clear architectural boundaries

4. **Simpler Testing**
   - No mocking of permission systems
   - No testing of permission cache invalidation
   - No testing of recipient mapping logic

5. **Transparency**
   - Users see all possible actions
   - Users learn what capabilities exist
   - Users can request permissions if needed

6. **No Stale Permissions**
   - Permissions checked in real-time by external services
   - No cache synchronization issues

7. **External Recipient Support**
   - Works for users not in Kubernetes (vendors, contractors)
   - No special handling for external recipients

### Negative

1. **User May See Unavailable Actions**
   - Users may click actions they cannot perform
   - **Mitigation**: External service provides clear "Forbidden" or "Unauthorized" messages
   - **Assessment**: This is acceptable UX - users learn about capabilities and can request access

2. **No Permission-Based Action Prioritization**
   - Cannot sort actions by "actions you can perform" vs "actions you cannot"
   - **Mitigation**: Action prioritization based on AI confidence and risk level (not permissions)
   - **Assessment**: Permission-agnostic prioritization is more maintainable

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: RBAC Pre-Filtering (Rejected)

**Approach**: Kubernaut queries external services to check recipient permissions before including actions in notifications.

**Rejected Because**:
- Too complex (~500 lines of code)
- Tight coupling to external services
- Requires caching (stale permissions risk)
- Fails for external recipients
- Wrong separation of concerns

### Alternative 2: Hide Actions Without Permission Info (Rejected)

**Approach**: If Kubernaut cannot determine permissions, hide the action entirely.

**Rejected Because**:
- Information hiding (users don't know capabilities exist)
- Prevents users from requesting access
- Assumes Kubernaut knows all permission systems

### Alternative 3: Show All Actions with Warning (Considered, Not Needed)

**Approach**: Show all actions with a warning: "Some actions may require additional permissions."

**Not Needed Because**:
- External services already provide clear auth feedback
- Adding warnings adds unnecessary complexity
- Current approach is self-explanatory

## Implementation Changes

### Removed Components

1. ‚ùå `RecipientMapper` interface - No longer needed
2. ‚ùå `RBACChecker` interface - No longer needed
3. ‚ùå Kubernetes `SubjectAccessReview` checks - No longer needed
4. ‚ùå Git provider permission checks - No longer needed
5. ‚ùå Permission caching logic - No longer needed
6. ‚ùå Recipient-to-user mapping configuration - No longer needed

### Updated Data Structures

**Before (with RBAC filtering)**:
```go
type EscalationNotificationResponse struct {
    NotificationID       string
    RBACFiltering        RBACFilteringResult  // ‚ùå Remove
    VisibleActions       []Action             // ‚ùå Remove
    HiddenActions        []Action             // ‚ùå Remove
}
```

**After (no RBAC filtering)**:
```go
type EscalationNotificationResponse struct {
    NotificationID       string
    SanitizationApplied  []SanitizationResult
    DataFreshness        DataFreshnessResult
    DeliveryResults      []DeliveryResult
    ActionsIncluded      []Action  // All recommended actions (no filtering)
}
```

### Configuration Changes

**Before**: Complex recipient mapping
```yaml
recipients:
  "sre-oncall@company.com":
    k8s_user: "system:serviceaccount:kubernaut-system:sre-bot"
    git_user: "sre-oncall-bot"
    rbac_check: true
  "external-vendor@partner.com":
    rbac_check: false
```

**After**: No recipient mapping needed (removed entirely)
