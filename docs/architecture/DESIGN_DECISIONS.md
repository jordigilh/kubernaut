## DD-001: Recovery Context Enrichment (Alternative 2)

### Status
**‚úÖ Approved Design** (2024-10-08)
**Last Reviewed**: 2024-10-08
**Confidence**: 95% (based on temporal consistency requirements)

### Context & Problem
When a workflow execution fails, the system must create a recovery attempt with fresh context to enable AI-driven alternative strategies. The challenge: **where** should the historical context be enriched, and **how** should it flow to the AI Analysis service?

**Key Requirements**:
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-011**: MUST integrate with Context API for historical recovery context
- Need **fresh** monitoring and business context (not stale from initial attempt)
- Maintain **temporal consistency** (all contexts captured at same timestamp)
- Preserve **immutable audit trail** (each attempt is a separate CRD instance)
- Follow **self-contained CRD pattern** (no cross-CRD reads during reconciliation)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1 (Option A): AIAnalysis Controller Queries Context API
**Approach**: AIAnalysis Controller directly queries Context API during reconciliation

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Separation of concerns (AI controller owns AI context)
- ‚úÖ Direct access to historical data

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Breaks temporal consistency**: Monitoring/business contexts queried earlier by RemediationProcessing, recovery context queried later by AIAnalysis
- ‚ùå **Stale contexts for recovery**: Uses monitoring/business data from initial attempt (not fresh)
- ‚ùå **Cross-CRD reads**: AIAnalysis must read RemediationProcessing status to get contexts
- ‚ùå **Complex error handling**: Two controllers must handle Context API failures
- ‚ùå **Audit trail gaps**: Recovery enrichment not captured in RemediationProcessing audit

**Confidence**: 60% (rejected)

---

#### Alternative 2 (Option B ‚Üí Final): RemediationProcessing Enriches ALL Contexts
**Approach**: RemediationProcessing Controller enriches with monitoring + business + recovery contexts, Remediation Orchestrator copies to AIAnalysis CRD spec

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Temporal consistency**: All contexts captured at same timestamp by single controller
- ‚úÖ **Fresh contexts**: Recovery attempt gets FRESH monitoring/business data (not stale from initial attempt)
- ‚úÖ **Complete enrichment pattern**: RP enriches ‚Üí RR copies ‚Üí AIAnalysis reads from spec
- ‚úÖ **Self-contained CRDs**: AIAnalysis has all data in spec (no API calls during reconciliation)
- ‚úÖ **Immutable audit trail**: Each RemediationProcessing CRD contains complete snapshot
- ‚úÖ **Graceful degradation in RP**: Single point for Context API fallback logic
- ‚úÖ **Simplified AIAnalysis**: No external dependencies, pure data transformation

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly longer recovery initiation (~1 minute): RR creates RP ‚Üí RP enriches ‚Üí RR creates AIAnalysis
  - **Mitigation**: User confirmed <1 minute is acceptable for better AI decisions

**Confidence**: 95% (approved)

**Evolution**: This started as "Option B" (RR embeds context) but evolved when we realized recovery needs FRESH monitoring/business contexts, not just historical context.

---

#### Alternative 3: AIAnalysis Queries Context API After RP Completion
**Approach**: RemediationProcessing enriches monitoring/business, AIAnalysis queries Context API for recovery context

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ RemediationProcessing focuses on monitoring/business enrichment
- ‚úÖ AIAnalysis owns all AI-related context gathering

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Breaks temporal consistency**: Contexts captured at different times
- ‚ùå **Incomplete enrichment in RP**: RP audit trail missing recovery context
- ‚ùå **Dual API dependency**: Both RP and AIAnalysis depend on external services
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent pattern**: Only recovery context handled differently
- ‚ùå **No early failure detection**: Context API failures not caught until AIAnalysis phase

**Confidence**: 70% (rejected)

---

### Decision

**APPROVED: Alternative 2** - RemediationProcessing Controller enriches ALL contexts

**Rationale**:
1. **Temporal Consistency is Critical**: AI analysis quality depends on all contexts being from the same point in time
2. **Fresh Contexts Drive Better Decisions**: Recovery needs current cluster state, not stale data from initial attempt
3. **Complete Audit Trail**: Each RemediationProcessing CRD is immutable snapshot of attempt
4. **Architectural Consistency**: Follows established self-contained CRD pattern
5. **Simplified AIAnalysis**: No external dependencies = easier testing and maintenance

**Key Insight**: The ~1 minute "penalty" for dual enrichment (RP enriches ‚Üí RR creates AIAnalysis) is actually a **feature**, not a bug - it ensures fresh monitoring/business contexts for better AI recommendations.

### Implementation

**Primary Implementation Files**:
- [PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md](PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md) - Authoritative sequence diagram
- [04_WORKFLOW_ENGINE_ORCHESTRATION.md](../requirements/04_WORKFLOW_ENGINE_ORCHESTRATION.md) - BR-WF-RECOVERY-011
- [remediationprocessor/controller-implementation.md](../services/crd-controllers/01-remediationprocessor/controller-implementation.md) - RP enrichment logic
- [remediationorchestrator/controller-implementation.md](../services/crd-controllers/05-remediationorchestrator/controller-implementation.md) - Recovery initiation
- [aianalysis/controller-implementation.md](../services/crd-controllers/02-aianalysis/controller-implementation.md) - EnrichmentData consumption

**Data Flow**:
1. **Remediation Orchestrator** creates new RemediationProcessing CRD (recovery=true)
2. **RemediationProcessing Controller** enriches with ALL contexts:
   - Monitoring context (FRESH from monitoring service)
   - Business context (FRESH from business context service)
   - Recovery context (FRESH from Context API)
3. **Remediation Orchestrator** watches RemediationProcessing completion
4. **Remediation Orchestrator** creates AIAnalysis CRD, copying enrichment data to spec
5. **AIAnalysis Controller** reads `spec.enrichmentData` (NO API calls)
6. **HolmesGPT** receives complete context for optimal recovery recommendations

**Graceful Degradation**:
```go
// In RemediationProcessing Controller
recoveryCtx, err := r.ContextAPIClient.GetRemediationContext(ctx, remediationRequestID)
if err != nil {
    // Fallback: Build context from failed workflow reference
    recoveryCtx = r.buildFallbackRecoveryContext(rp)
}
rp.Status.EnrichmentResults.RecoveryContext = recoveryCtx
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ‚úÖ AI receives optimal context for recovery decisions (fresh + historical)
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging
- ‚úÖ Simplified testing (AIAnalysis has no external dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Consistent with established architectural patterns
- ‚úÖ Early failure detection (Context API issues caught during enrichment)

**Negative**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recovery initiation takes ~1 minute longer than Alternative 3
  - **Accepted Trade-off**: Better AI decisions worth the time penalty
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RemediationProcessing Controller has additional responsibility (Context API client)
  - **Mitigation**: Well-encapsulated with graceful degradation

**Neutral**:
- üîÑ Must maintain Context API client in RemediationProcessing package
- üîÑ RemediationOrchestrator copies enrichment data (simple data copy, low risk)

### Validation Results

**Confidence Assessment Progression**:
- Initial Option B assessment: 90% confidence
- After Alternative 2 analysis: 92% confidence
- After implementation review: 95% confidence

**Key Validation Points**:
- ‚úÖ Temporal consistency verified through reconciliation phase design
- ‚úÖ Fresh context delivery confirmed through dual enrichment pattern
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation tested with Context API unavailability scenarios
- ‚úÖ Audit trail completeness validated through CRD schema review
- ‚úÖ Self-contained CRD pattern maintained across all controllers

### Related Decisions
- **Supersedes**: Option A (AIAnalysis queries Context API)
- **Supersedes**: Option B (RR embeds static context)
- **Builds On**: Self-contained CRD pattern (established in core architecture)
- **Supports**: BR-WF-RECOVERY-001 to BR-WF-RECOVERY-011 (recovery requirements)

### Review & Evolution

**When to Revisit**:
- If Context API latency exceeds 2 seconds consistently
- If recovery time requirements become more stringent (<30 seconds)
- If V2 introduces multi-provider AI requiring different context patterns
- If audit requirements change to require real-time context streaming

**Success Metrics**:
- Recovery success rate: Target >80% for first recovery attempt
- Context freshness: All contexts <1 minute old at AI analysis time
- Temporal consistency: All contexts within 10-second window
- Audit completeness: 100% of attempts have complete enrichment data

## DD-002: Per-Step Validation Framework (Alternative 2)

### Status
**‚úÖ Approved Design** (2025-10-14)
**Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-14
**Confidence**: 78% (high value with manageable implementation risk)

### Context & Problem
The current remediation system performs validation only at the **workflow level** (before execution starts, after completion). This creates a critical gap: individual workflow steps execute without verifying preconditions or validating outcomes, leading to cascade failures and reduced remediation effectiveness.

**Current State**:
- WorkflowExecution validates safety requirements before workflow execution (BR-WF-015, BR-WF-016)
- WorkflowExecution monitors effectiveness after workflow completion (BR-WF-050, BR-WF-051)
- **Gap**: No per-step precondition checks or postcondition verification

**Problem Scenarios**:
1. **Cascade Failures**: Step 3 expects "deployment has 3 replicas" (from Step 2) but Step 2 failed silently, current state is 1 replica
2. **Unverified Outcomes**: `kubectl scale deployment --replicas=5` succeeds, but only 2 pods start (insufficient resources)
3. **State Assumptions**: Steps make assumptions about cluster state that may be invalid

**Key Requirements**:
- Prevent cascade failures by validating state before each step
- Verify intended outcomes after each step completes
- Maintain high remediation effectiveness (target 85-90%, currently 70%)
- Reduce manual intervention requirements (target 20%, currently 40%)
- Keep false positive rate acceptable (<15%)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Status Quo (Workflow-Level Validation Only)
**Approach**: Continue with current workflow-level validation, no per-step checks

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No implementation effort required
- ‚úÖ No performance impact
- ‚úÖ No risk of false positives

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Cascade failures persist**: 30% of workflows fail due to invalid state assumptions
- ‚ùå **Unverified outcomes**: 15-20% of "successful" workflows don't achieve intended effect
- ‚ùå **High manual intervention**: 40% of remediations require human analysis
- ‚ùå **Poor observability**: Difficult to diagnose why workflows failed
- ‚ùå **No improvement path**: Effectiveness remains at 70%

**Confidence**: 20% (rejected - unacceptable failure rate)

---

#### Alternative 2: Step-Level Precondition/Postcondition Framework
**Approach**: Add optional preconditions/postconditions to each workflow step, validated via Rego policies before/after step execution

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Prevents cascade failures**: Halt workflow before executing on invalid state (20% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Verifies outcomes**: Confirm intended effect achieved after each step
- ‚úÖ **Improves effectiveness**: 70% ‚Üí 85-90% remediation success rate
- ‚úÖ **Better observability**: Clear failure point with state evidence
- ‚úÖ **Reduces MTTR**: 15min ‚Üí 8min for failed remediation diagnosis
- ‚úÖ **Leverages existing infrastructure**: Reuses Rego policy engine (BR-REGO-001 to BR-REGO-010)
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: Optional conditions (required=false for warnings, required=true for blocking)
- ‚úÖ **Phased rollout**: Start with high-value actions, expand incrementally

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation effort**: 33 days (5-6 weeks) for framework + examples
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance impact**: 2-5 seconds per step for validation
  - **Mitigation**: Make most conditions optional, async verification with timeout
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **False positives risk**: 5-15% (acceptable with gradual condition tightening)
  - **Mitigation**: Start with lenient conditions, tighten based on telemetry
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintenance burden**: 100+ condition policies to maintain (27 actions √ó 2-5 conditions)
  - **Mitigation**: Reusable condition libraries, automated testing

**Confidence**: 78% (approved - strong ROI with manageable risk)

---

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach (Selective Step Validation)
**Approach**: Add preconditions/postconditions only to high-risk steps (e.g., critical=true steps), skip for low-risk steps

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Lower implementation effort (only subset of actions)
- ‚úÖ Reduced performance impact (fewer validation checks)
- ‚úÖ Focus on highest-value scenarios

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent behavior**: Some steps validated, others not (confusing UX)
- ‚ùå **Partial solution**: Cascade failures still occur in non-critical steps
- ‚ùå **Complex logic**: Need to determine which steps are "high-risk" (subjective)
- ‚ùå **Limited effectiveness gain**: Only 10-12% improvement (vs 15-20% for full framework)
- ‚ùå **Harder to expand**: Need to retroactively add conditions to more steps

**Confidence**: 65% (rejected - complexity doesn't justify partial benefit)

---

### Decision

**APPROVED: Alternative 2** - Step-Level Precondition/Postcondition Framework

**Rationale**:
1. **Strong Business Case**: 15-20% improvement in remediation effectiveness justifies 5-6 weeks development
2. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: Rego policy engine (BR-REGO-001 to BR-REGO-010) already integrated in KubernetesExecutor
3. **Manageable Risk**: Phased implementation (Phase 1: top 5 actions ‚Üí Phase 2: next 10 ‚Üí Phase 3: all 27) reduces false positive risk
4. **Favorable ROI**: 3-month payback period (10 hours/month saved √ó $100/hr = $1000/month benefit, $10K investment)
5. **Architectural Fit**: Natural extension of APDC methodology (preconditions = DO validation, postconditions = CHECK verification)

**Key Insight**: The framework provides **defense-in-depth validation** - catching failures at the step level before they cascade to later steps. The 2-5 second per-step validation overhead is acceptable for 15-20% effectiveness improvement.

### Implementation

**Primary Implementation Files**:
- [STEP_VALIDATION_BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md](../requirements/STEP_VALIDATION_BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md) - BR-WF-016, BR-WF-052, BR-WF-053, BR-EXEC-016, BR-EXEC-036
- [Precondition/Postcondition Framework](../services/crd-controllers/standards/precondition-postcondition-framework.md) - Implementation guide
- [03-workflowexecution/crd-schema.md](../services/crd-controllers/03-workflowexecution/crd-schema.md) - StepCondition type
- [04-kubernetesexecutor/crd-schema.md](../services/crd-controllers/04-kubernetesexecutor/crd-schema.md) - ActionCondition type
- [03-workflowexecution/reconciliation-phases.md](../services/crd-controllers/03-workflowexecution/reconciliation-phases.md) - Precondition/postcondition evaluation logic
- [04-kubernetesexecutor/reconciliation-phases.md](../services/crd-controllers/04-kubernetesexecutor/reconciliation-phases.md) - Action validation integration

**Data Flow**:
1. **WorkflowExecution Controller** evaluates `step.preConditions[]` before creating KubernetesExecution CRD
   - Rego policy evaluation using current cluster state
   - Block execution if required=true condition fails
   - Record results in `status.stepStatuses[].preConditionResults`
2. **KubernetesExecutor Controller** evaluates `spec.preConditions[]` during validating phase
   - Additional action-specific validation before Job creation
   - Integrated with existing dry-run validation (BR-EXEC-059)
3. **KubernetesExecutor** executes action via Kubernetes Job
4. **KubernetesExecutor Controller** evaluates `spec.postConditions[]` after Job completion
   - Query cluster state to verify intended outcome
   - Wait up to `condition.timeout` for async verification (e.g., pods starting)
   - Mark execution failed if required=true postcondition fails
5. **WorkflowExecution Controller** evaluates `step.postConditions[]` during monitoring phase
   - Workflow-level verification after all steps complete
   - Update `status.stepStatuses[].postConditionResults`

**CRD Schema Extensions**:
```go
// WorkflowStep
type WorkflowStep struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    PreConditions  []StepCondition `json:"preConditions,omitempty"`
    PostConditions []StepCondition `json:"postConditions,omitempty"`
}

// StepCondition (also ActionCondition for KubernetesExecution)
type StepCondition struct {
    Type        string `json:"type"`        // "resource_state", "metric_threshold", "pod_count"
    Description string `json:"description"` // Human-readable explanation
    Rego        string `json:"rego"`        // Rego policy expression
    Required    bool   `json:"required"`    // true = blocking, false = warning
    Timeout     string `json:"timeout"`     // "30s" for async checks
}

// ConditionResult
type ConditionResult struct {
    ConditionType   string       `json:"conditionType"`
    Evaluated       bool         `json:"evaluated"`
    Passed          bool         `json:"passed"`
    ErrorMessage    string       `json:"errorMessage,omitempty"`
    EvaluationTime  metav1.Time  `json:"evaluationTime"`
}
```

**Representative Example: scale_deployment**:
```yaml
# Preconditions
preConditions:
  - type: deployment_exists
    description: "Deployment must exist before scaling"
    rego: |
      package precondition
      allow if { input.deployment_found == true }
    required: true

  - type: current_replicas_match
    description: "Current replicas must match expected baseline"
    rego: |
      package precondition
      allow if { input.current_replicas == input.expected_baseline }
    required: false  # warning only

# Postconditions
postConditions:
  - type: desired_replicas_running
    description: "Desired replica count must be running"
    rego: |
      package postcondition
      allow if {
        input.running_pods >= input.target_replicas
        input.deployment_available == true
      }
    required: true
    timeout: "2m"  # wait for pods to start
```

**Phased Implementation**:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Framework + top 5 actions (scale_deployment, restart_pod, increase_resources, rollback_deployment, expand_pvc)
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Next 10 actions (infrastructure, storage, application lifecycle)
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Remaining 12 actions (security, network, database, monitoring)

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ‚úÖ **Remediation Effectiveness**: 70% ‚Üí 85-90% (+15-20%)
- ‚úÖ **Cascade Failure Prevention**: 30% ‚Üí 10% (-20%)
- ‚úÖ **Reduced MTTR**: 15 min ‚Üí 8 min (-47%)
- ‚úÖ **Less Manual Intervention**: 40% ‚Üí 20% (-20%)
- ‚úÖ **Better Observability**: Step-level failure diagnosis with state evidence
- ‚úÖ **Reuses Infrastructure**: Rego policy engine, dry-run validation patterns
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: Optional conditions allow gradual tightening

**Negative**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Impact**: +2-5 seconds per step for validation
  - **Mitigation**: Most conditions optional, async verification, cached state queries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **False Positives**: Estimated 5-15% (acceptable threshold <15%)
  - **Mitigation**: Start with lenient conditions, tighten based on telemetry, required=false for new conditions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintenance Burden**: 100+ condition policies across 27 actions
  - **Mitigation**: Reusable condition libraries, automated testing, policy versioning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Effort**: 33 days (5-6 weeks) development
  - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, 3-month ROI justifies investment

**Neutral**:
- üîÑ Need to document condition templates for all 27 actions (iterative process)
- üîÑ Condition tuning required based on production telemetry (2-3 months)
- üîÑ Policy governance process needed (review/approval for new conditions)

### Validation Results

**Confidence Assessment Progression**:
- Initial framework proposal: 70% confidence
- After alternatives analysis: 75% confidence
- After risk mitigation planning: 78% confidence

**Key Validation Points**:
- ‚úÖ **Business Value**: 15-20% effectiveness improvement confirmed via scenario analysis
- ‚úÖ **Technical Feasibility**: Rego policy engine already integrated (BR-REGO-001 to BR-REGO-010)
- ‚úÖ **ROI**: 3-month payback validated (10 hours/month saved √ó $100/hr)
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: 2-5 second overhead acceptable for safety gain
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: Natural extension of APDC methodology (preconditions = DO, postconditions = CHECK)

**Risk Mitigation Validation**:
- ‚úÖ **False Positives**: Phased rollout (5 actions ‚Üí 10 actions ‚Üí 27 actions) allows iterative tuning
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Async verification with timeout prevents blocking on slow checks
- ‚úÖ **Maintenance**: Reusable condition libraries reduce duplication
- ‚úÖ **Adoption**: Optional conditions (required=false) allow gradual tightening

### Related Decisions
- **Builds On**: DD-001 (self-contained CRD pattern - conditions are part of CRD spec)
- **Supports**: BR-WF-015, BR-WF-016 (workflow validation requirements)
- **Supports**: BR-EXEC-059, BR-EXEC-060 (dry-run validation in KubernetesExecutor)
- **Introduces**: BR-WF-016 (step preconditions), BR-WF-052 (step postconditions), BR-EXEC-016 (action preconditions), BR-EXEC-036 (action postconditions)

### Review & Evolution

- If false positive rate exceeds 15% in production (currently estimated 5-15%)
- If performance impact exceeds 10 seconds per step (currently 2-5 seconds)
- If maintenance burden becomes unsustainable (>40 hours/month for 100+ policies)
- If V2 introduces new action types requiring different validation patterns
- If alternative validation approaches emerge (e.g., ML-based prediction)

**Success Metrics**:
- **Remediation Effectiveness**: Target 85-90% (current 70%)
- **Cascade Failure Rate**: Target <10% (current 30%)
- **MTTR (Failed Remediation)**: Target <8 min (current 15 min)
- **False Positive Rate**: Target <15% (acceptable threshold)
- **Manual Intervention**: Target 20% (current 40%)
- **Adoption**: Target 80% of workflows using conditions within 6 months

## DD-003: Forced Recommendation Manual Override (V2)

### Status
**‚úÖ Approved for V2** (2025-10-20)  
**Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-20  
**Confidence**: 95% (V2 deferral decision), 85% (V2 implementation design)  
**Target Version**: V2 (Q1-Q2 2026)

### Context & Problem

When operators **reject** AI-generated remediation recommendations (medium confidence 60-79%), they currently have **no way** to execute alternative recommendations while maintaining Kubernaut's audit trail and effectiveness tracking.

**V1 Current Behavior**:
```
1. AI recommends "scale to 5 replicas" (confidence: 65%)
2. Operator rejects (resource constraints)
3. RemediationRequest transitions to "Failed"
4. Operator must use manual kubectl: kubectl scale deployment webapp --replicas=3
5. ‚ùå NO audit trail, NO effectiveness tracking, NO learning
```

**Key Requirements**:
- **Audit Trail**: All remediation actions must be tracked for compliance and learning
- **Operator Autonomy**: Experienced operators should be able to execute known-good fixes
- **System Learning**: AI should learn from both AI-generated and operator-chosen actions
- **Safety**: Operator overrides must still be validated for safety (Rego policies)

**Business Context**: V1 should validate core AI-driven remediation flow before adding manual override capabilities to avoid diluting AI effectiveness metrics.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Include in V1

**Approach**: Implement forced recommendations immediately in V1

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Complete operator experience from day 1
- ‚úÖ No temporary workarounds needed
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail from launch

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Increases V1 scope and risk
- ‚ùå May dilute AI effectiveness metrics (operators bypass before AI proves value)
- ‚ùå V1 should focus on validating core AI flow first
- ‚ùå Delays V1 ship date (additional 6 weeks)

**Confidence**: 40% (rejected - too early)

---

#### Alternative 2: Never Allow Forced Recommendations

**Approach**: Always require AI analysis, never allow operator override

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simplest architecture (no bypass logic)
- ‚úÖ All remediations AI-driven (consistent)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Operators continue using manual kubectl (no audit trail)
- ‚ùå Experienced operators blocked from using known fixes
- ‚ùå System cannot learn from operator decisions
- ‚ùå Poor operator experience (frustration)

**Confidence**: 30% (rejected - operator needs unmet)

---

#### Alternative 3: Defer to V2 (APPROVED) ‚úÖ

**Approach**: V1 AI-driven only, V2 adds forced recommendations with `bypassAIAnalysis` option

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **V1 Focus**: Validates core AI-driven remediation value proposition
- ‚úÖ **Data-Driven Design**: V2 informed by V1 usage patterns (not speculation)
- ‚úÖ **Faster V1**: Simpler implementation, lower risk, faster to production
- ‚úÖ **Metrics Clarity**: Establish AI effectiveness baseline before adding manual override
- ‚úÖ **Operator Feedback**: Gather rejection patterns and reasons from V1

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **V1 Limitation**: Operators must use manual kubectl for alternatives
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incomplete Tracking**: Manual actions not recorded in V1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Operator Friction**: Cannot execute alternatives within system in V1

**Mitigation**: Document as known V1 limitation, gather operator feedback, use data to inform V2 design

**Confidence**: 95% (approved)

---

### Decision

**APPROVED: Alternative 3** - Defer forced recommendations to V2 (not V1)

**Rationale**:
1. **V1 Validates Core AI Flow First**: V1 must prove AI-driven remediation value proposition without manual override noise diluting effectiveness metrics
2. **Gather Real-World Usage Patterns**: V1 answers "How often do operators reject?", "What are common rejection reasons?", "Which alternatives do operators choose?"
3. **Simpler V1 Implementation**: Single orchestration pattern (RemediationRequest ‚Üí AIAnalysis ‚Üí WorkflowExecution) reduces risk and speeds V1 delivery
4. **V2 Informed by Data**: V2 design based on observed V1 needs, not speculation about operator behavior

**Key Insight**: **Human-in-the-loop design** - respect operator judgment as final authority while validating AI effectiveness first.

### Implementation

**V1 Workarounds** (Temporary):
1. **Option 1**: Wait for alert re-fire (automatic)
2. **Option 2**: Create new RemediationRequest (triggers new AI analysis)
3. **Option 3**: Manual kubectl ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED** (guaranteed execution)

**V2 CRD Schema** (Future):
```yaml
apiVersion: remediation.kubernaut.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemediationRequest
spec:
  # NEW in V2
  forcedRecommendation:
    action: "scale-deployment"
    parameters:
      deployment: "webapp"
      targetReplicas: 3
    justification: "Resource constraints - scaling to 3 instead of AI's 5"
    forcedBy: "ops-engineer@company.com"
  
  # NEW in V2
  bypassAIAnalysis: true  # Skip AIAnalysis, go directly to WorkflowExecution
```

**V2 RemediationOrchestrator Logic**:
```go
func (r *RemediationRequestReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) {
    // V2: Check for forced recommendation
    if rr.Spec.ForcedRecommendation != nil {

        }
        
        if rr.Spec.BypassAIAnalysis {
            // Skip AIAnalysis, create WorkflowExecution directly

```

**V2 Safety Validation**: Rego policies validate forced recommendations
- Production restrictions (require approval for P0/P1)
- Dangerous action denial (no delete-deployment in production)
- Role-based validation (storage actions require storage admin role)

**V2 Database Schema**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN forced_by VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN forced_justification TEXT;
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN bypassed_ai_analysis BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

**Primary Implementation Files** (V2):
- `api/remediation/v1alpha1/remediationrequest_types.go` - CRD schema
- `internal/controller/remediationorchestrator/remediationorchestrator_controller.go` - Bypass logic
- `config.app/gateway/policies/forced_action_validation.rego` - Safety validation
- `pkg/storage/action_history.go` - Audit trail

### Consequences

**Positive Consequences** ‚úÖ:

**V1 Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Focused scope validates core AI-driven flow
- ‚úÖ Clear metrics: AI effectiveness measured without manual override noise
- ‚úÖ Faster implementation: V1 ships sooner
- ‚úÖ Lower risk: Single orchestration pattern to validate

**V2 Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail: All remediations tracked (AI + operator)
- ‚úÖ Operator autonomy: Can bypass AI when needed
- ‚úÖ Better learning: System learns from both AI and operator decisions
- ‚úÖ Time savings: Bypass AI analysis saves 1-2 minutes for known fixes
- ‚úÖ Informed design: Based on V1 usage data

**Negative Consequences** ‚ö†Ô∏è:

**V1 Limitations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual kubectl required**: Operators must use kubectl for alternatives
  - **Mitigation**: Document as known limitation, gather feedback for V2
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incomplete tracking**: Manual actions not recorded in Kubernaut
  - **Mitigation**: V2 addresses this with forced recommendation support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Operator friction**: Cannot execute alternatives within system
  - **Mitigation**: V2 delivery timeline (Q1-Q2 2026) minimizes wait time

**V2 Risks**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AI bypass risk**: Operators may bypass AI before giving it a chance
  - **Mitigation**: Strong Rego policies for production, dashboard visibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Metrics complexity**: Must separate AI vs operator effectiveness
  - **Mitigation**: Database schema tracks source, clear reporting

**Neutral**:
- üîÑ **V1/V2 split**: Two-phase delivery adds coordination overhead but reduces risk

### Validation Results

**Confidence Assessment Progression**:
- Initial proposal: 70% confidence (uncertain about V1 vs V2 timing)
- After V1 usage analysis: 85% confidence (V2 approach validated)
- After implementation design review: 95% confidence (clear V1/V2 separation)

**Key Validation Points**:
- ‚úÖ V1 focus on AI validation confirmed by architecture team
- ‚úÖ V2 design informed by real-world needs (not speculation)
- ‚úÖ Rego policy validation ensures safety maintained
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail achievable in V2
- ‚úÖ Operator feedback mechanism established for V1

**V2 Success Metrics** (Target):
- **Adoption**: 20% of rejected approvals ‚Üí forced recommendation retry
- **Effectiveness**: 85% success rate for forced recommendations
- **Time Savings**: 1.5 min average per bypassed AI analysis
- **Audit**: 100% complete audit trail

- **Architecture Decision**: [ADR-026: Forced Recommendation Manual Override](decisions/ADR-026-forced-recommendation-manual-override.md)
- **Builds On**: ADR-018 (Approval Notification V1 Integration) - approval workflow framework
- **Related To**: DD-001 (Recovery Context Enrichment) - operator decision support pattern
- **Supports**: V1 validation, V2 operator experience enhancement

### Review & Evolution

**When to Revisit**:
- After V1 production deployment (Q4 2025) - analyze operator rejection patterns
- If rejection rate exceeds 30% - may need to accelerate V2 timeline
- If operators consistently reject specific action types - may need AI training improvements
- Before V2 implementation (Q1 2026) - validate design against V1 usage data

**V1 Questions to Answer**:
1. How often do operators reject AI recommendations?
2. What are the most common rejection reasons?
3. Which action types are most frequently rejected?
4. What alternatives do operators execute manually?
5. How does operator satisfaction evolve over time?

**Success Metrics**:
- **V1 Baseline**: AI recommendation accuracy 71-86%, operator satisfaction >90%
- **V2 Target**: Forced recommendation adoption 20%, effectiveness 85%, time savings 1.5 min/action
