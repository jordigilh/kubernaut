## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES**

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Every service in the architecture has **exactly one responsibility**:

| Service | Single Responsibility |
|---------|----------------------|
| **🔗 Gateway** | HTTP Gateway & Security Only |
| **🧠 Alert Processor** | Alert Processing Logic Only |
| **🤖 AI Analysis** | AI Analysis & Decision Making Only |
| **🎯 Workflow Orchestrator** | Workflow Execution Only |
| **⚡ K8s Executor** | Kubernetes Operations Only |
| **📊 Data Storage** | Data Persistence Only |
| **🔍 Intelligence** | Pattern Discovery Only |
| **📈 Effectiveness Monitor** | Effectiveness Assessment Only |
| **🌐 Context API** | Context Orchestration Only |
| **📢 Notifications** | Multi-Channel Notifications Only |

### **Business-Driven Design**
- **Complete BR Coverage**: All 1,500+ business requirements mapped to services
- **Justified Connectivity**: Every service connection serves a specific business purpose
- **External Integration**: Proper integration with all required external systems
- **Operational Excellence**: Built-in monitoring, security, and reliability

## 🔄 **SERVICE FLOW OVERVIEW**

```
External Alert → Gateway → Alert Processor → AI Analysis → Workflow Orchestrator
                                                              ↓
Notifications ← Context API ← Effectiveness Monitor ← Intelligence ← Data Storage ← K8s Executor
```

### **Key Integration Points**
- **Entry Point**: Gateway Service (Prometheus/Grafana webhooks)
- **Intelligence Core**: AI Analysis Service (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure)
- **Action Execution**: K8s Executor Service (Multi-cluster operations)
- **Learning Engine**: Intelligence Service (Pattern discovery)
- **External AI**: Context API Service (HolmesGPT integration)
- **Communication**: Notification Service (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty)
