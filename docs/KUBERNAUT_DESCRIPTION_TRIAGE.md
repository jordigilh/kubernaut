- **Per-step validation**: Pre-condition and post-condition checks (DD-002)
- **29 canonical action types**: Defined, validated, production-ready actions

**Confidence**: 100%

---

### 4. "reducing mean time to resolution" ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: **IMPRECISE - NEEDS QUALIFICATION**
**Issue**: MTTR claims are estimates/targets, not validated production data

**Evidence**:
- **Baseline MTTR**: ~60 minutes (estimated industry average)
- **Target MTTR**: 2-8 minutes by scenario (estimated, 93% projected success rate)
- **Documentation**: docs/value-proposition/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md shows targets, not actuals
- **Reality**: No production data yet to validate these estimates

**Recommendation**: Add "target" or "estimated" qualifiers

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Unqualified claims suggest proven results vs projections

**Confidence**: 100%

---

### 5. "maintaining operational safety" ‚úÖ
**Status**: **ACCURATE**
**Evidence**:

- **GitOps PR**: Evidence-based pull requests for permanent fixes
- **Integration**: Documented in docs/value-proposition/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md:63-74

**Why It Matters**: Critical for GitOps-managed environments (ArgoCD, FluxCD)

**Recommendation**: Add "integrates with GitOps workflows" or "GitOps-aware remediation"

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Major differentiator vs competitors

---

### 9. Pattern Learning & Historical Intelligence üö®
**Status**: **NOT MENTIONED - LEARNING CAPABILITY**
**V1 Feature**: Vector database for pattern recognition and effectiveness tracking

**Evidence**:
- **Local Vector DB**: PostgreSQL-based similarity search (Context API)
- **Action history**: Recall similar incidents and proven solutions
- **Effectiveness tracking**: Learn from past remediations
- **Continuous improvement**: 92% confidence from historical patterns

**Why It Matters**: This enables continuous improvement and intelligent recommendations

**Recommendation**: Add "learns from historical patterns" or "continuous improvement through pattern recognition"

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Intelligence capability not communicated

---

### 10. Tekton Pipelines Execution üö®
**Status**: **NOT MENTIONED - ARCHITECTURE DECISION**
**V1 Feature**: CNCF Graduated Tekton Pipelines for remediation execution

**Evidence**:
- **ADR-023**: Using Tekton from V1 (docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-023-tekton-from-v1.md)
- **Benefits**: Industry standard, DAG orchestration, retry/timeout, universal availability
- **Confidence**: 95% (eliminating custom orchestration code)

**Why It Matters**: Shows commitment to industry standards, not custom solutions

**Recommendation**: Optional addition: "powered by Tekton Pipelines" or "CNCF-based execution engine"

**Impact**: **LOW** - Implementation detail, but adds credibility

---

### 11. 29+ Canonical Action Types üö®
**Status**: **NOT MENTIONED - BREADTH OF CAPABILITY**
**V1 Feature**: Comprehensive remediation action library

**Evidence**:
- **29 action types**: Scaling, restarts, rollbacks, node operations, storage, network, database, security, diagnostics

‚úÖ **Qualified MTTR claims**: "targeting" and "estimated" make clear these are projections
‚úÖ **Adds key differentiator**: Multi-step workflow orchestration
‚úÖ **Conservative approach**: Doesn't oversell V2 capabilities (multi-cloud, advanced features)
‚úÖ **Honest positioning**: Reflects current implementation state

**Confidence**: 95% (validated against actual V1 implementation status)

## üîç **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

- [x] Compared against V1 architecture (APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Verified signal sources (ADR-015-alert-to-signal-naming-migration.md)
- [x] Confirmed safety mechanisms (ADR-002, DD-002)
- [x] Validated MTTR claims (EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
- [x] Checked action types (CANONICAL_ACTION_TYPES.md)
- [x] Confirmed GitOps integration (EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
- [x] Verified Tekton architecture (ADR-023-tekton-from-v1.md)
- [x] Validated multi-step capabilities (MULTI_STEP_WORKFLOW_EXAMPLES.md)
- [x] Confirmed pattern learning (Context API, Vector DB)

**Result**: Original description is 90% accurate for V1, but needs MTTR qualification. "Kubernetes incidents" is correct - don't change it. Multi-step workflows should be added as key differentiator.
