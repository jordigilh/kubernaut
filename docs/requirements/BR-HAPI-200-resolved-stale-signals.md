# BR-HAPI-200: Handling Inconclusive Investigations

**ID**: BR-HAPI-200
**Title**: Handling Inconclusive LLM Investigations and Self-Resolved Signals
**Category**: HAPI (HolmesGPT-API)
**Priority**: 🔴 P0 (V1.0 BLOCKER)
**Version**: V1.0
**Status**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Date**: December 7, 2025

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

In production Kubernetes environments, signals (alerts/events) can **self-resolve** before or during LLM investigation:

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Pod Restart** | OOMKilled pod automatically restarts and becomes healthy |
| **Transient Network** | Network partition resolves before investigation |
| **Auto-scaling** | HPA scales up, resolving resource pressure |
| **Self-Healing** | Application recovers from temporary failure |
| **Race Condition** | Signal created, but issue resolves before HAPI processes it |

**Current Gap**: When the LLM investigates and finds **no reproducible problem**, there is:
1. No explicit `HumanReviewReason` for this case
2. No prompt guidance telling the LLM how to respond
3. No clear signal to downstream services (AIAnalysis, RO, Notification)

### Business Impact

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unnecessary Workflows** | LLM may recommend remediation for non-existent problems |
| **Operator Confusion** | No clear indication that problem self-resolved |
| **Audit Gap** | Cannot track "problem resolved before remediation" events |
| **Resource Waste** | Executing workflows against healthy resources |

### Business Value

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Safety** | Prevents unnecessary remediation of healthy resources |
| **Clarity** | Clear signal to operators: "Problem resolved, no action needed" |
| **Audit Trail** | Track self-resolution events for operational insights |
| **Efficiency** | Avoid wasting workflow execution resources |

## Requirements

### BR-HAPI-200.1: New HumanReviewReason Value

**MUST**: Add `INVESTIGATION_INCONCLUSIVE` to the `HumanReviewReason` enum.

```python
class HumanReviewReason(str, Enum):
    # ... existing values ...
    INVESTIGATION_INCONCLUSIVE = "investigation_inconclusive"
```

**Semantics**: LLM investigation did not yield conclusive results - could not determine root cause or current state.

**Important Distinction**:
- `INVESTIGATION_INCONCLUSIVE` = LLM **uncertain**, needs human judgment → `needs_human_review=true`
- Problem **confirmed resolved** = LLM **confident** no action needed → `needs_human_review=false`, `selected_workflow=null`

---

### BR-HAPI-200.2: LLM Prompt Guidance

**MUST**: The LLM investigation prompt SHALL include explicit guidance for this scenario:

```
IMPORTANT: If you cannot verify the reported problem exists (e.g., the resource
is now healthy, events show a past issue but current state is normal, or the
symptoms described in the signal cannot be reproduced), you MUST:

1. Set "needs_human_review": true
2. Set "human_review_reason": "investigation_inconclusive"
3. Provide a detailed "investigation_summary" explaining:
   - What you investigated
   - What the current state is
   - Why the problem could not be reproduced
4. Set "selected_workflow": null (no workflow needed)
5. Add a warning: "Problem could not be reproduced - resource appears healthy"

This is a VALID outcome - not all signals require remediation.
```

---

### BR-HAPI-200.3: Response Structure - Two Distinct Outcomes

#### Outcome A: Problem Confirmed Resolved (No Human Review)

**MUST**: When LLM **confidently** determines the problem is resolved, return:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "inc-123",
  "remediation_id": "rem-456",
  "investigation_summary": "Investigated OOMKilled signal for pod 'myapp-abc123'. Current status: Running (healthy). Pod events show OOMKilled at 10:15:00 UTC, but pod successfully restarted at 10:15:03 UTC. Current memory usage: 45% of limit. No remediation required.",
  "selected_workflow": null,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "needs_human_review": false,
  "human_review_reason": null,
  "warnings": [
    "Problem self-resolved - no remediation required",
    "Pod automatically recovered from OOMKilled event"
  ],
  "target_in_owner_chain": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-07T10:20:00Z"
}
```

**Key**: `needs_human_review=false` because LLM is confident. This is a successful outcome.

#### Outcome B: Investigation Inconclusive (Human Review Required)

**MUST**: When LLM **cannot determine** root cause or current state, return:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "inc-123",
  "remediation_id": "rem-456",
  "investigation_summary": "Unable to determine root cause for reported OOMKilled signal. Pod status is ambiguous - events show multiple restarts but current state unclear. Metrics unavailable.",
  "selected_workflow": null,
  "confidence": 0.35,
  "needs_human_review": true,
  "human_review_reason": "investigation_inconclusive",
  "warnings": [
    "Investigation inconclusive - human review recommended",
    "Could not verify current resource state"
  ],
  "target_in_owner_chain": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-07T10:20:00Z"
}
```

**Key**: `needs_human_review=true` because LLM is uncertain. Requires human judgment.

---

### BR-HAPI-200.4: Confidence Semantics

**SHOULD**: The `confidence` field SHALL reflect the LLM's confidence in its assessment (not confidence in a workflow selection).

| Confidence | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 0.9-1.0 | Very confident problem is resolved |
| 0.7-0.9 | Reasonably confident, may warrant monitoring |
| < 0.7 | Uncertain - may need human verification |

---

### BR-HAPI-200.5: Audit Requirements

**MUST**: For both investigation outcomes, the audit trail SHALL capture:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `event_type` | `llm_response` |
| `outcome` | `resolved` or `inconclusive` |
| `investigation_summary` | Full summary from LLM |
| `original_signal_type` | From request |
| `current_resource_state` | From LLM investigation |

---

## Consumer Behavior Requirements

### BR-HAPI-200.6: AIAnalysis Handling

**MUST**: AIAnalysis SHALL handle both outcomes:

#### Decision Tree (Evaluation Order)

**CRITICAL**: The `needs_human_review` check MUST be evaluated **before** the "ProblemResolved" check.
Evaluating in the wrong order causes high-confidence inconclusive investigations to be misclassified as "ProblemResolved".

```
1. needs_human_review=true                              → WorkflowResolutionFailed (Layer 1)
2. !hasSelectedWorkflow && confidence >= 0.7
   && no inconclusive/no-match warning signals          → ProblemResolved (Outcome A)
3. !hasSelectedWorkflow                                 → NoWorkflowTerminalFailure
4. hasSelectedWorkflow && confidence < 0.7              → LowConfidenceFailure
5. default (workflow selected, confidence >= 0.7)       → Proceed to Analyzing phase
```

**Defense-in-Depth (Layer 2)**: Even when `needs_human_review=false`, the "ProblemResolved" path
verifies that HAPI's warnings do not contain signals indicating an active problem. This catches
edge cases where the LLM incorrectly overrides `needs_human_review=false` but HAPI's
`result_parser` still appends diagnostic warnings from `investigation_outcome` processing.

Warning signals that block "ProblemResolved" classification:
- `"inconclusive"` - from HAPI when `investigation_outcome == "inconclusive"`
- `"no workflows matched"` - from HAPI when `selected_workflow` is null and outcome is not "resolved"
- `"human review recommended"` - general HAPI safety signal

#### Outcome A: Problem Resolved (`needs_human_review=false`, `human_review_reason=null`)

AIAnalysis detects this pattern: `needs_human_review=false` AND `selected_workflow=null` AND `confidence >= 0.7` AND no inconclusive/no-match warning signals

1. **NOT** create a WorkflowExecution CRD
2. Transition to `Completed` phase
3. Set `reason: WorkflowNotNeeded`
4. Set `subReason: ProblemResolved` (derived by AIAnalysis)

```yaml
status:
  phase: Completed
  reason: WorkflowNotNeeded
  subReason: ProblemResolved
  message: "Problem self-resolved. No remediation required."
```

#### Outcome B: Investigation Inconclusive (`needs_human_review=true`, `human_review_reason=investigation_inconclusive`)

1. **NOT** create a WorkflowExecution CRD
2. Transition to `Failed` phase
3. Set `reason: WorkflowResolutionFailed`
4. Set `subReason: InvestigationInconclusive` (from HAPI enum)

```yaml
status:
  phase: Failed
  reason: WorkflowResolutionFailed
  subReason: InvestigationInconclusive
  message: "Investigation inconclusive - human review recommended."
```

---

### BR-HAPI-200.7: Remediation Orchestrator Handling

**SHOULD**: When AIAnalysis completes with `reason: WorkflowNotNeeded`, RO SHALL:

1. Update RemediationRequest status to reflect no action needed
2. NOT create any workflow execution
3. Emit `kubernaut_remediationorchestrator_no_action_needed_total{reason="problem_resolved|investigation_inconclusive"}` metric

---

### BR-HAPI-200.8: Notification Handling

**SHOULD**: Operators MAY configure notification rules for self-resolved incidents:

| Notification Type | Use Case |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Skip** | Most self-resolutions don't need notification |
| **Informational** | "FYI: Incident auto-resolved" for audit |
| **Warning** | Pattern of repeated self-resolutions (flapping) |

---

## Detection Criteria

### BR-HAPI-200.9: When to Report Each Outcome

#### Outcome A: Report "Resolved" (High Confidence)

The LLM SHALL return `investigation_outcome: "resolved"` when **confident** (≥0.7):

| Condition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Resource Healthy** | Pod status is `Running`, no error conditions |
| **Explicit Recovery** | Events show recovery after the issue |
| **Metrics Normal** | CPU/memory/disk returned to normal range |

#### Outcome B: Report "Inconclusive" (Low Confidence)

The LLM SHALL return `investigation_outcome: "inconclusive"` when **uncertain** (<0.5):

| Condition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Ambiguous State** | Pod status unclear, conflicting events |
| **Missing Data** | Metrics/events unavailable |
| **Conflicting Signals** | Some indicators healthy, others not |

---

## Non-Requirements

### What This BR Does NOT Cover

1. **Flapping Detection** - Detecting patterns of repeated self-resolution (future BR)
2. **Signal Staleness Check** - Checking signal age before investigation (different layer)
3. **Automatic Suppression** - Auto-closing signals without investigation (not safe)

---

## Acceptance Criteria
