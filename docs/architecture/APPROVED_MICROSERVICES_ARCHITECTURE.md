# Kubernaut - Approved Microservices Architecture

**Document Version**: 2.2
**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: **V1 IMPLEMENTATION** - Current Architecture Specification (Updated: CRD Lifecycle & Retention Policy Added)
**Architecture Type**: V1 Microservices (11 Services) with V2 Roadmap (15 Services)

---

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document defines the **V1 microservices architecture** for Kubernaut, an intelligent Kubernetes remediation agent. The V1 architecture implements **12 core microservices** (5 CRD controllers + 7 stateless services), each adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, with a **V2 roadmap** for 4 additional advanced services. This provides rapid deployment capability while maintaining complete business requirements coverage.

**V2.1 Update**: Effectiveness Monitor Service moved from V2 to V1 with graceful degradation strategy to enable progressive capability improvement as remediation data accumulates.

### **V1 Implementation Strategy**
**Complete V1 Strategy**: See [Implementation Roadmap](KUBERNAUT_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for detailed V1 timeline (3-4 weeks), HolmesGPT-API integration approach, and 95% confidence assessment.

### **Key Architecture Principles**
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has exactly one responsibility
- **Business-Driven Decomposition**: Services align with business capabilities
- **Minimal Coupling**: Services communicate only when business requirements demand it
- **External System Integration**: Proper integration with all required external systems
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service scales based on its specific workload

### **🔄 Service Flow Summary**

**V1 Primary Processing Path**:
```
Signal Sources → Gateway → Remediation Processor → AI Analysis → Workflow Execution → K8s Executor → Kubernetes
```

**AI Investigation Loop** (V1):
```
AI Analysis ↔ HolmesGPT API ↔ Context API
                    ↕
              Dynamic Toolset (provides toolset configuration)
```

**Storage Interactions** (Query Pattern):
- **K8s Executor** → Storage (writes execution results)
- **AI Analysis** → Storage (queries historical patterns)
- **Effectiveness Monitor** → Storage (queries action history for assessment and loop detection)

**Effectiveness Monitor Pattern**:
- Queries `action_history` table in PostgreSQL/Storage for effectiveness assessment
- Queries external Prometheus/Grafana for metrics correlation
- Detects remediation loops (same action on same resource repeatedly)
- Performs multi-dimensional effectiveness analysis (traditional score + environmental impact)
- Triggers alerts to Notifications when remediation loops detected or effectiveness declining

**Notification Triggers**:
- **Context API** → Notifications (alerts and updates)
- **Workflow Execution** → Notifications (status updates)
- **Effectiveness Monitor** → Notifications (loop detection alerts, effectiveness trends)

**V2 Enhanced Path** (Future):
```
Signal Sources → Gateway → Remediation Processor → AI Analysis → Multi-Model Orchestration → Workflow Execution → K8s Executor
```

**Investigation Capabilities**:
- **Dynamic Toolsets**: HolmesGPT tools configured via Dynamic Toolset service
- **LLM-Driven Tool Selection**: LLM decides which investigation tools to use based on signal symptoms
- **Adaptive Context Fetching**: LLM requests specific historical data from Context API as needed
- **Iterative Investigation**: LLM requests tools → HolmesGPT executes → LLM analyzes results
- **Multi-Source Data**: Combines historical context, cluster state, logs, events, metrics
- **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis**: LLM correlates historical + current data to identify root cause
- **Safety Validation**: All recommendations validated before execution

**Key Design**: The LLM uses **function calling** to request specific investigation tools dynamically, including:
- **Kubernetes Tools**: `get_pods`, `get_logs`, `get_events` (current cluster state)
- **Context API Tools**: `get_similar_incidents`, `get_success_rate`, `get_environment_constraints` (historical intelligence)
- **Adaptive Strategy**: LLM decides which tools to use and when, rather than pre-fetching all context upfront

This allows the investigation to adapt based on the signal type and initial findings, fetching only the historical context actually needed.

- **Clear Separation**: Main processing, AI investigation, and support services are independently grouped
- **Query-Based Storage**: Services query Storage on-demand (not push-based)
- **External Infrastructure**: Prometheus/Grafana are external systems (not kubernaut services)
- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Multiple services can trigger notifications independently
- **Oscillation Detection**: Handled by Effectiveness Monitor via PostgreSQL queries

### **CRD Lifecycle & Retention Management**

**CRD Retention Policy**: Automated lifecycle management for Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions

**Retention Strategy**:
- **RemediationRequest CRDs**: 24-hour retention after completion/failure/timeout (configurable per environment)
- **Service CRDs**: Cascade deletion when parent RemediationRequest is deleted (automatic via owner references)
- **Audit Data**: Long-term retention in PostgreSQL (default: 90 days, configurable per environment)
- **Review Window**: CRDs persist for operational review and troubleshooting before automatic cleanup

**Implementation Details**:
- **Finalizer Pattern**: Prevents premature deletion during 24-hour retention window
- **Owner References**: All service CRDs (RemediationProcessing, AIAnalysis, WorkflowExecution, KubernetesExecution) owned by RemediationRequest for automatic cascade deletion
- **Cleanup Automation**: Kubernetes garbage collector handles cascade deletion of all child CRDs
- **Audit Persistence**: Complete remediation audit trail stored in PostgreSQL before CRD deletion

**Configuration**:
- **Development**: 1-hour retention (fast iteration)
- **Staging**: 24-hour retention (default)
- **Production**: 90-day retention (compliance and audit requirements)

**Design Reference**: See [05-central-controller.md](../services/crd-controllers/05-central-controller.md) and [OWNER_REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../services/crd-controllers/OWNER_REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed CRD lifecycle implementation.

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: V1 Core Services (Weeks 1-4) - 12 Services**
1. Gateway Service - HTTP gateway and security
2. Remediation Processor Service - Alert processing logic
3. AI Analysis Service - AI analysis and decision making
4. Workflow Execution Service - Workflow execution
5. K8s Executor Service - Kubernetes operations
6. Data Storage Service - Data persistence and vector database
7. Context API Service - Context orchestration (HolmesGPT-optimized)

### **Phase 2: Advanced Services (Weeks 5-8)**
12. Multi-Model Orchestration Service - Ensemble AI decisions
13. Intelligence Service - Pattern discovery
14. Security & Access Control Service - RBAC and authentication
