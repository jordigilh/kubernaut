### 4.5 Security Intelligence MCP Server ‚≠ê **SECURITY-FOCUSED ENTERPRISE FEATURE**
**Status**: üîÑ Pending  
**Priority**: Medium (Enterprise Security Enhancement)  
**Duration**: 5-7 weeks  
**Owner**: TBD

**Objective**: Provide AI models with real-time security intelligence for enhanced threat-aware decision making

**Strategic Value**: Enable security-informed remediation decisions based on CVE data, vulnerability assessments, and network security policies

#### Security Intelligence Capabilities:

##### CVE & Vulnerability Management
```go
// Security MCP Server providing vulnerability intelligence
type SecurityMCPServer struct {
    cveDatabase      CVEClient        // NIST NVD, CVE API integration
    vulnerabilityDB  VulnerabilityDB  // Trivy, Grype, Snyk integration  
    imageScanner     ImageScanner     // Container image vulnerability scanning
    networkPolicy    NetworkAnalyzer  // Ingress/egress security analysis
    complianceRules  ComplianceEngine // Security compliance validation
}

// Available security tools for models:
// - check_image_cves, validate_network_policies, assess_pod_security
// - lookup_vulnerability_severity, check_compliance_status
// - analyze_network_connectivity, validate_rbac_permissions
```

##### Core Security Functions:
- **CVE Lookup & Analysis**: Real-time vulnerability data for container images
- **Network Security Assessment**: Ingress/egress connectivity validation and recommendations
- **Image Security Scanning**: Container vulnerability analysis with severity scoring
- **Compliance Validation**: Security policy compliance checks (PCI, SOC2, etc.)
- **Security Risk Scoring**: Threat level assessment for remediation actions

#### Security-Informed Remediation Scenarios:

##### 1. **Image Rollback with CVE Awareness**
```yaml
# Traditional approach:
alert: "DeploymentFailure"
action: "rollback_deployment"
reasoning: "Rollback to previous revision"

# Security-enhanced approach:
alert: "DeploymentFailure" 
security_context:
  current_image: "app:v2.1.0"
  previous_image: "app:v2.0.5"
  cve_analysis:
    current_vulnerabilities: ["CVE-2024-1234 (CRITICAL)", "CVE-2024-5678 (HIGH)"]
    previous_vulnerabilities: ["CVE-2023-9999 (MEDIUM)"]
action: "rollback_deployment"
reasoning: "Rollback justified - previous image has lower security risk (1 MEDIUM vs 2 CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs)"
```

##### 2. **Network Connectivity with Security Policy Validation**
```yaml
# Enhanced network troubleshooting:
alert: "NetworkConnectivityIssue"
security_context:
  network_policies: 
    - name: "deny-all-egress"
      status: "active"
      impact: "blocks external connectivity"
  ingress_rules:
    - allowed_ports: ["80", "443"]
    - blocked_ports: ["22", "3389"]
action: "update_network_policy"
reasoning: "Network policy 'deny-all-egress' blocking legitimate traffic - propose temporary egress allowlist"
```

##### 3. **Pod Security with CVE Mitigation**
```yaml
# Security-aware pod management:
alert: "PodSecurityViolation"  
security_context:
  image_scan_results:
    vulnerabilities: ["CVE-2024-0001 (CRITICAL) - RCE in base image"]
    recommendations: ["Update to base image patched version", "Apply security patches"]
  security_policies:
    pod_security_standards: "restricted"
    non_compliance: ["runAsRoot: true", "privileged: true"]
action: "quarantine_pod"
reasoning: "CRITICAL CVE with RCE potential + policy violations require immediate isolation"
```

#### Implementation Architecture:

##### Security Data Integration:
```go
// CVE and vulnerability data sources
type SecurityDataSources struct {
    NVDClient      *nvd.Client        // NIST National Vulnerability Database
    TrivyScanner   *trivy.Scanner     // Container vulnerability scanning
    GrypeScanner   *grype.Scanner     // Anchore Grype integration
    SnykClient     *snyk.Client       // Snyk vulnerability database
    ImageRegistry  ImageRegistryClient // Container registry integration
}

// Network security analysis
type NetworkSecurityAnalyzer struct {
    PolicyEngine   NetworkPolicyEngine
    IngressRules   IngressAnalyzer
    EgressRules    EgressAnalyzer  
    ComplianceDB   ComplianceDatabase
}
```

- **check_compliance_requirements(namespace, policy_type)**: Compliance validation
- **get_security_recommendations(alert_type, resource_context)**: Security-aware suggestions

#### Advanced Security Intelligence:

##### Threat-Aware Action Selection:
```go
// Security risk assessment for remediation actions
type SecurityRiskAssessment struct {
    Action           string
    TargetResource   Resource
    SecurityRisk     SecurityRiskLevel
    CVEImpact       []CVEAssessment
    ComplianceImpact ComplianceRisk
    NetworkImpact    NetworkSecurityRisk
    Recommendation   SecurityRecommendation
}

// Risk-based action prioritization
func (s *SecurityMCPServer) AssessActionSecurity(action Action, context AlertContext) SecurityRiskAssessment {
    // Analyze CVE implications
    cveRisk := s.assessCVERisk(action.TargetImage)
    
    // Validate network security impact
    networkRisk := s.assessNetworkImpact(action.NetworkChanges)
    
    // Check compliance implications
    complianceRisk := s.assessComplianceImpact(action.PolicyChanges)
    
    return SecurityRiskAssessment{
        Action: action.Type,
        SecurityRisk: calculateOverallRisk(cveRisk, networkRisk, complianceRisk),
        Recommendation: generateSecurityRecommendation(cveRisk, networkRisk, complianceRisk),
    }
}
```
