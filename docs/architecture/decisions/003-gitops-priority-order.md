# GitOps Remediation Priority Order - Final Design

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED**
**Confidence**: **88% (HIGH)**

---

## 🎯 **FINAL PRIORITY ORDER**

```
1️⃣  NOTIFICATION/ESCALATION (Manual Control) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
    └─ Rego policy says "escalate"
    └─ Overrides GitOps PR and direct patch
    └─ Use case: Operator wants manual control

2️⃣  GITOPS PR (Reviewed Automation) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
    └─ Rego policy says "automate" + GitOps annotations exist
    └─ Safer than direct patch (Git review required)
    └─ Use case: Production with ArgoCD/Flux

3️⃣  DIRECT PATCH (Full Automation) - LOWEST PRIORITY
    └─ Rego policy says "automate" + NO GitOps annotations
    └─ Fastest remediation (3 min)
    └─ Use case: Dev/test without GitOps
```

## 🔑 **KEY USER CLARIFICATIONS**

### **Clarification 1**: Rego Can Override GitOps
> "If argocd/flux annotation exists and rego policy states escalate, then escalate takes precedence."

**Impact**:
- Rego policy is evaluated FIRST (highest priority)
- If Rego says "escalate", system escalates even with ArgoCD annotations
- Allows operator control even in GitOps environments

### **Clarification 2**: Priority Order Matters
> "notification -> gitops PR -> direct update/patch should be the order of priority"

**Impact**:
- Escalation/notification has highest priority
- GitOps PR is safer than direct patch (Git review)
- Direct patch is fastest but lowest priority (dev/test only)

### **Clarification 3**: Operator Control Use Case
> "This will avoid scenarios where operators want to be notified and manually remediate the problem even if argocd is in place."

**Impact**:
- Production environments: Force escalation even with ArgoCD
- Critical alerts: Always notify operator (manual control)
- High-risk actions: Require manual approval regardless of GitOps

## 💻 **CODE IMPLEMENTATION** ✅ **CORRECTED**

### **Decision Flow**

```go
func (r *AIAnalysisReconciler) determineRemediationPath(
    ctx context.Context,
    aiAnalysis *aiv1.AIAnalysis,
) (RemediationPath, error) {

    resource, err := r.getTargetResource(ctx, aiAnalysis)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("get target resource: %w", err)
    }

    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // STEP 1: EVALUATE REGO POLICY FIRST (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    hasGitOps := hasGitOpsAnnotations(resource)

    regoResult, err := r.regoEvaluator.Evaluate(ctx, "kubernaut.remediation.decide_action", map[string]interface{}{
        "environment":       r.getEnvironment(resource),
        "action":            aiAnalysis.Spec.RecommendedAction,

        "confidence":        aiAnalysis.Status.Confidence,
        "alertSeverity":     aiAnalysis.Spec.Alert.Severity,
    })

    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // PRIORITY 1: ESCALATION (Manual Control)
    // Rego says "escalate" - overrides everything
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    if regoResult.Action == "escalate" {
        return r.escalationFlow, nil  // PRIORITY 1 (highest)
    }

    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // PRIORITY 2: GITOPS PR (if GitOps annotations exist)
    // Rego says "automate" + GitOps annotations exist
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    if hasGitOps && regoResult.Action == "automate" {
        return r.gitPRFlow, nil  // PRIORITY 2 (medium)
    }

    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // PRIORITY 3: DIRECT PATCH (NO GitOps annotations)
    // Rego says "automate" + NO GitOps annotations
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    if !hasGitOps && regoResult.Action == "automate" {
        return r.directPatchFlow, nil  // PRIORITY 3 (lowest)

## 📜 **REGO POLICY EXAMPLE**

```rego
package kubernaut.remediation

# Default: escalate (safest)
default decide_action = {
    "action": "escalate",
    "reason": "No policy rule matched"
}

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PRIORITY 1: FORCE ESCALATION (Operator Control)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Rule 1.1: Production always requires manual approval
decide_action = {
    "action": "escalate",
    "reason": "Production environment - manual approval required"
} if {
    contains(lower(input.environment), "prod")
}

# Rule 1.2: Critical alerts require manual review
decide_action = {
    "action": "escalate",
    "reason": "Critical severity - manual review required"
} if {
    input.alertSeverity == "critical"
}

# Rule 1.3: Low confidence requires human decision
decide_action = {
    "action": "escalate",
    "reason": "AI confidence too low - manual review required"
} if {
    input.confidence < 0.75
}

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PRIORITY 2 & 3: ALLOW AUTOMATION
# Code decides between GitOps PR (if annotations) or Direct Patch (if no annotations)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Rule 2.1: Allow automation for dev/test
decide_action = {
    "action": "automate",
    "reason": "Low-risk action in dev/test - automation allowed"
} if {
    input.environment in ["dev", "test", "local"]
    input.action in ["scale-memory", "restart-deployment"]
    input.confidence >= 0.75
    input.alertSeverity in ["warning", "info"]

## 📧 **ESCALATION NOTIFICATION PAYLOAD** (BR-NOT-026 through BR-NOT-037)

When PRIORITY 1 (Escalation) is triggered, the notification sent to operators MUST include:

**Requirements Applied**:
- ✅ BR-NOT-026 through BR-NOT-033: Core escalation context
- ✅ BR-NOT-034: Sensitive data sanitization
- ✅ BR-NOT-035: Data freshness indicators
- ✅ BR-NOT-036: Channel-specific formatting
- ✅ BR-NOT-037: Recipient-aware RBAC filtering

      Pattern Analysis (BR-AI-037):
      - OOM count: 3 events in 1 hour
      - Memory usage: 95% sustained (chronic)
      - Heap growth: 5MB/min (elevated but not leak)
      - Decision: Chronic insufficiency → Memory increase required

      Evidence:
      - Memory utilization sustained at 95%+ for 45 minutes
      - OOM events occurring every ~20 minutes
      - Heap growth rate is linear (not exponential, ruling out leak)
      - GC pressure is elevated but GC remains effective

    whyThisRootCause: |
      Selected "chronic memory insufficiency" because:
      1. Repeated OOMs (3 in 1h) indicate sustained, not transient, issue
      2. Memory usage sustained at 95%+ (not spike-driven)
      3. Heap growth linear (rules out memory leak)
      4. GC remains effective (rules out GC thrashing)
    alternativeHypotheses:
      # BR-NOT-029 REVISED: Max 3 alternatives, only those >10% confidence
      - hypothesis: "Memory leak in application code"
        confidence: 0.15
        rejected: "Heap growth is linear (5MB/min), not exponential. Memory leak would show accelerating growth."
      - hypothesis: "Transient spike (high load)"

## 🎯 **EXAMPLE SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario A: Production + ArgoCD + Rego Forces Escalation**
```
Environment: production
ArgoCD: ✅ YES (argocd.argoproj.io/instance: "webapp-prod")
AI Confidence: 0.95 (very high)
Action: scale-memory

Decision Flow:
1. Rego Policy: Environment = "production" → Rule 1.1 → "escalate"
2. Result: PRIORITY 1 (Escalation)
   → Send notification to operator
   → Operator decides: Manual Git PR or ignore

Note: Even though ArgoCD exists (would normally trigger Git PR),
      production environment forces escalation (PRIORITY 1 overrides PRIORITY 2)
```

### **Scenario B: Dev + ArgoCD + Rego Allows Automation**
```
Environment: dev
ArgoCD: ✅ YES (argocd.argoproj.io/instance: "webapp-dev")
AI Confidence: 0.88
Action: scale-memory

Decision Flow:
1. Rego Policy: Dev + low-risk + high confidence → Rule 2.1 → "automate"
2. Check GitOps: ArgoCD annotations detected
3. Result: PRIORITY 2 (GitOps PR)
   → Create Git PR with evidence
   → Human reviews and approves
   → ArgoCD syncs (15-30 min)

Note: Rego allows automation, and ArgoCD exists, so Git PR is created
```

### **Scenario C: Dev + No GitOps + Rego Allows Automation**
```
Environment: dev
ArgoCD: ❌ NO (no annotations)
AI Confidence: 0.88
Action: scale-memory

Decision Flow:
1. Rego Policy: Dev + low-risk + high confidence → Rule 2.1 → "automate"
2. Check GitOps: No annotations detected
3. Result: PRIORITY 3 (Direct Patch)
   → Dry-run validation
   → Apply patch directly
   → Fixed (3 min)

Note: Rego allows automation, and NO GitOps, so direct patch is fastest
```

### **Scenario D: Dev + No GitOps + Low Confidence**
```
Environment: dev
ArgoCD: ❌ NO (no annotations)
AI Confidence: 0.68 (low)
Action: scale-memory

Decision Flow:
1. Rego Policy: Confidence < 0.75 → Rule 1.3 → "escalate"
2. Result: PRIORITY 1 (Escalation)
   → Send notification to operator
   → Wait for manual intervention

Note: Even though dev + no GitOps (would allow direct patch),
      low confidence forces escalation (PRIORITY 1 overrides PRIORITY 3)
```

---

## ✅ **BENEFITS OF CORRECT PRIORITY ORDER**

### **1. Operator Control (Primary Benefit)**
- ✅ Operators can force manual intervention even with ArgoCD
- ✅ Production always requires manual approval (safety)
- ✅ Critical alerts always notify operator

### **2. Appropriate Automation**
- ✅ Git PR for GitOps environments (maintains Git as source of truth)
- ✅ Direct patch for dev/test without GitOps (fastest remediation)
- ✅ Automation only when safe (Rego policy decides)

### **3. Flexibility**
- ✅ Rego policy is configurable (environment-specific rules)
- ✅ Priority order is fixed (notification > GitOps > direct)
- ✅ Supports all use cases (manual control, GitOps, full automation)

---

## 📊 **CONFIDENCE EVOLUTION**

| Version | Design | Confidence | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Initial** | GitOps check blocks everything | 72% | No operator control with GitOps |
| **Revision 1** | Rego first, no separate flag | 82% | Still no operator control use case |
| **Final** | Rego highest priority, correct order | **88%** ✅ | All use cases supported |

**Why 88% (HIGH)**:
1. ✅ Rego policy has highest priority (operator control)
2. ✅ Priority order is correct (notification > GitOps > direct)
3. ✅ All use cases supported (manual, GitOps, automation)
4. ✅ Simpler design (no separate config flags)
5. ✅ Fail-safe (escalation is default)

---

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

### **Must Have**:
- ✅ Rego policy evaluation as PRIORITY 1
- ✅ Support "escalate" and "automate" actions in Rego
- ✅ GitOps annotation check AFTER Rego allows automation
- ✅ Priority order: Escalation → GitOps PR → Direct Patch
- ✅ Production escalation rule (Rule 1.2)
- ✅ Mandatory dry-run before direct patch
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail

### **Should Have**:
- ✅ Critical alert escalation rule (Rule 1.1)
- ✅ Low confidence escalation rule (Rule 1.3)
- ✅ High-risk action escalation rule (Rule 1.4)
- ✅ HPA/VPA conflict detection
