# Context API v2.2 - Phase 2 Completion Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Task**: Template v2.0 Structural Compliance  
**Duration**: 47 minutes (actual time)  
**Implementation Plan**: [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.0.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.0.md) (updated to v2.2)

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Align Context API Implementation Plan with Service Implementation Plan Template v2.0 structural standards to prevent future implementation setbacks.

**User Concern** (that triggered this work):
> "We've already spent a lot of time fixing these non-TDD tests and I'm concerned if we continue ahead with the plan as-is we might have future setbacks. I want to make sure the plan moving forward is 100% correct."
