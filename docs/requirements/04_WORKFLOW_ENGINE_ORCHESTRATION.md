#### 2.3.3 Recovery Loop Prevention & Coordination
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Critical Fix (C3)
**Reference**: [`docs/architecture/PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md`](../architecture/PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md)

##### Recovery Attempt Limits
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-001**: MUST limit recovery attempts to maximum of 3 per RemediationRequest
  - **Rationale**: Prevents infinite recovery loops and resource exhaustion
  - **Implementation**: Track `recoveryAttempts` counter in RemediationRequest.status
  - **Success Criteria**: System escalates to manual review after 3 failed recovery attempts
  - **Monitoring**: Track `kubernaut_recovery_attempts_total` metric

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-002**: MUST increment recovery attempt counter each time a new recovery AIAnalysis CRD is created
  - **Rationale**: Accurate tracking of recovery progression
  - **Implementation**: Increment in Remediation Orchestrator when creating recovery AIAnalysis
  - **Success Criteria**: Counter accurately reflects number of recovery workflows executed

##### Pattern Detection & Escalation
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-003**: MUST detect repeated failure patterns and escalate to manual review
  - **Rationale**: Avoid wasting resources on strategies that consistently fail
  - **Pattern Definition**: Same failure signature (action + error type + step) occurs twice
  - **Implementation**: Track failure signatures across WorkflowExecutionRefs array
  - **Success Criteria**: System escalates when identical failure pattern detected twice
  - **Example**: Two consecutive "scale-deployment timeout at step 3" failures → escalate

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-004**: MUST escalate to manual review when recovery viability evaluation fails
  - **Rationale**: Human intervention required when automated recovery is not viable
  - **Escalation Triggers**:
    - Max recovery attempts exceeded (BR-WF-RECOVERY-001)
    - Repeated failure pattern detected (BR-WF-RECOVERY-003)
    - Termination rate exceeded (BR-WF-RECOVERY-005)
  - **Implementation**: Set `escalatedToManualReview: true` and send notification
  - **Success Criteria**: Operations team receives notification within 30 seconds

##### Termination Rate Monitoring
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-005**: MUST track system-wide termination rate and prevent recovery when rate exceeds 10% (BR-WF-541)
  - **Rationale**: System-wide safety mechanism to prevent cascade failures
  - **Calculation**: `(failedWorkflows / totalWorkflows)` in last 1 hour
  - **Implementation**: Remediation Orchestrator calculates rate before creating recovery workflow
  - **Success Criteria**: No new recovery workflows created when termination rate ≥ 10%
  - **Monitoring**: `kubernaut_workflow_termination_rate` gauge metric

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-006**: MUST maintain audit trail of all recovery attempts in RemediationRequest.status
  - **Rationale**: Complete visibility into recovery progression for debugging and analysis
  - **Required Fields**:
    - `aiAnalysisRefs[]`: Array of all AIAnalysis CRDs (initial + recovery)
    - `workflowExecutionRefs[]`: Array with outcomes, failure details, attempt numbers
    - `recoveryAttempts`: Current counter
    - `lastFailureTime`: Timestamp of most recent failure
    - `escalatedToManualReview`: Boolean flag
  - **Success Criteria**: Complete recovery history available in CRD status
  - **Related**: See CRD schema in `docs/services/crd-controllers/05-remediationorchestrator/crd-schema.md`

##### Recovery Coordination
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-007**: MUST coordinate recovery through Remediation Orchestrator (NOT WorkflowExecution internal handling)
  - **Rationale**: Separation of concerns - WorkflowExecution detects failures, Remediation Orchestrator coordinates recovery
  - **Pattern**: WorkflowExecution updates status to "failed" → Remediation Orchestrator watches → creates new AIAnalysis
  - **Anti-Pattern**: WorkflowExecution directly handling its own recovery
  - **Success Criteria**: All recovery coordination logic resides in Remediation Orchestrator controller

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-008**: MUST create new AIAnalysis CRD for each recovery attempt with historical context
  - **Rationale**: AI needs previous failure information to recommend alternative strategies
  - **Context Sources**:
    - Context API: Historical failures, previous workflows, pattern data
    - Previous WorkflowExecution status: Failed step, error details, execution state
    - RemediationRequest status: Recovery attempt count, failure history
  - **Implementation**: AIAnalysis Controller queries Context API during recovery analysis
  - **Success Criteria**: Recovery AIAnalysis includes previous failure context in AI prompt

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-009**: MUST transition RemediationRequest to "recovering" phase during recovery coordination
  - **Rationale**: Clear visibility into recovery state for monitoring and debugging
  - **Phase Transitions**:
    - `executing` → (workflow fails) → `recovering` → (new workflow created) → `executing`
    - `recovering` → (recovery limit reached) → `failed` + escalate
  - **Implementation**: Remediation Orchestrator updates phase when creating recovery AIAnalysis
  - **Success Criteria**: "recovering" phase visible in RemediationRequest.status.overallPhase

##### Recovery Viability Evaluation
- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-010**: MUST evaluate recovery viability before creating new recovery workflow
  - **Rationale**: Prevent resource waste on unrecoverable scenarios
  - **Evaluation Criteria** (ALL must pass):
    1. Recovery attempts < max (BR-WF-RECOVERY-001)
    2. No repeated failure pattern (BR-WF-RECOVERY-003)
    3. Termination rate < 10% (BR-WF-RECOVERY-005)
  - **Implementation**: Remediation Orchestrator `evaluateRecoveryViability()` function
  - **Success Criteria**: Recovery only attempted when all criteria pass
  - **Metrics**: Track `kubernaut_recovery_viability_evaluations_total{outcome="allowed|denied|reason"}`

##### Context API Integration

> **📋 Design Decision**: [DD-001 - Alternative 2](../architecture/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-001-recovery-context-enrichment-alternative-2) | ✅ **Approved Design** | Confidence: 95%

- **BR-WF-RECOVERY-011**: MUST integrate with Context API for historical recovery context (Alternative 2 - Complete Enrichment)
  - **Rationale**: AI needs historical data AND fresh monitoring/business context to generate effective alternative strategies
  - **Design**: **RemediationProcessing Controller enriches ALL contexts** (temporal consistency + immutable audit trail)
  - **Context Data Required**:
    - Fresh monitoring context (current cluster state, resource metrics)
    - Fresh business context (current ownership, runbooks, SLA)
    - Recovery context from Context API:
      - Previous workflow execution details
      - Historical failure patterns for this alert type
      - Related alerts and correlations
      - Successful recovery strategies for similar failures
  - **Implementation Flow (Alternative 2)**:
    1. **Remediation Orchestrator** creates new RemediationProcessing CRD (recovery)
    2. **RemediationProcessing Controller** enriches with:
       - Monitoring context (queries monitoring service - FRESH!)
       - Business context (queries business context service - FRESH!)
       - Recovery context (queries Context API `/context/remediation/{id}` - FRESH!)
    3. **RemediationProcessing Controller** stores ALL contexts in `RemediationProcessing.status.enrichmentResults`
    4. **Remediation Orchestrator** watches completion, creates AIAnalysis with complete enrichment data
    5. **AIAnalysis Controller** reads ALL contexts from spec (no API calls needed)
  - **Graceful Degradation**: If Context API unavailable, RemediationProcessing Controller creates fallback context from `FailedWorkflowRef`
  - **Success Criteria**:
    - RemediationProcessing CRDs contain complete enrichment (monitoring + business + recovery)
    - AIAnalysis CRDs receive ALL contexts from RemediationProcessing
    - Temporal consistency maintained (all contexts captured at same timestamp)
    - Immutable audit trail (each RemediationProcessing CRD is separate)
  - **Reference**: See [`PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md`](../architecture/PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md) (Version 1.2 - Alternative 2)
