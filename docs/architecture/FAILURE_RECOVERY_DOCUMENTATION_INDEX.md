## 🔑 **Key Concepts Across Documents**

### **Recovery Loop Prevention**
- **Max Recovery Attempts**: 3 (4 total workflow executions)
- **Pattern Detection**: Same failure twice → escalate
- **Termination Rate**: BR-WF-541 (<10% requirement)

### **Controller Architecture**
- **WorkflowExecution Controller**: Single instance managing multiple CRDs
- **AIAnalysis Controller**: Single instance managing multiple CRDs
- **Remediation Orchestrator**: Central recovery coordinator
- **K8s Executor**: Action execution with validation

### **Context API Integration**
- Historical failure data
- Previous workflow executions
- Pattern recognition
- Graceful degradation if unavailable

### **Recovery Phases**
```
Initial → Analyzing → Executing → [Failure] → Recovering → Completed ✅
                                                         ↓
                                              Failed (escalate) ❌
