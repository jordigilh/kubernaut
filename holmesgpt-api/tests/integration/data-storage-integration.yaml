# Data Storage Service Configuration for Integration Tests
#
# Business Requirement: BR-STORAGE-013 - Semantic Search for Remediation Workflows
# Design Decision: DD-TEST-001 - Port Allocation Strategy
# ADR-030: Service Configuration Management
#
# DD-TEST-001: HolmesGPT-API uses dedicated container names (prefixed with 'hapi')
# to avoid conflicts with Data Storage's own integration tests.
#
# This configuration is used by the Data Storage Service container
# during integration testing.
