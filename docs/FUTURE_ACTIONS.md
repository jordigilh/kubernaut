# Future Actions - Next Phase Implementation

This document outlines additional actions that would be valuable to implement in the next phase of development. These actions extend beyond the current high-priority set and address more specialized operational scenarios.

## Current Actions (Implemented)

### Core Actions
- `scale_deployment` - Scale deployment replicas up or down
- `restart_pod` - Restart the affected pod(s)
- `increase_resources` - Increase CPU/memory limits
- `notify_only` - No automated action, notify operators only

### High-Priority Actions (Phase 1 - âœ… Implemented)
- `rollback_deployment` - Rollback deployment to previous working revision
- `expand_pvc` - Expand persistent volume claim size
- `drain_node` - Safely drain and cordon a node for maintenance
- `quarantine_pod` - Isolate pod with network policies for security
- `collect_diagnostics` - Gather detailed diagnostic information

## Future Actions (Next Phase)

### Storage & Persistence Actions
- `cleanup_storage` - Clean up old data/logs when disk space is critical
  - Use case: Disk space alerts, log rotation issues
  - Implementation: Execute cleanup scripts, delete old files, compress logs
  - Risk level: Medium (ensure critical data preservation)

- `backup_data` - Trigger emergency backups before taking disruptive actions
  - Use case: Before storage expansion or pod restarts involving data
  - Implementation: Trigger backup jobs, wait for completion
  - Risk level: Low (protective action)

### Security & Compliance Actions
- `rotate_secrets` - Rotate compromised credentials/certificates
  - Use case: Certificate expiration, credential compromise
  - Implementation: Generate new secrets, update deployments, rollout restart
  - Risk level: High (service disruption possible)

- `audit_logs` - Trigger detailed security audit collection
  - Use case: Security incidents, compliance requirements
  - Implementation: Collect logs, generate audit reports, export data
  - Risk level: Low (read-only operation)

### Network & Connectivity Actions
- `restart_network` - Restart network components (CNI, DNS)
  - Use case: Network connectivity issues, DNS resolution problems
  - Implementation: Restart DaemonSets, flush DNS caches
  - Risk level: High (cluster-wide network disruption)

- `update_network_policy` - Modify network policies for connectivity issues
  - Use case: Network access problems, security policy updates
  - Implementation: Update NetworkPolicy resources, validate connectivity
  - Risk level: Medium (can block legitimate traffic)

- `reset_service_mesh` - Reset service mesh configuration (Istio, Linkerd)
  - Use case: Service mesh failures, certificate issues
  - Implementation: Restart control plane, regenerate certificates
  - Risk level: High (affects all mesh services)

### Application Lifecycle Actions
- `update_hpa` - Modify horizontal pod autoscaler settings
  - Use case: Scaling issues, resource utilization problems
  - Implementation: Update HPA min/max replicas, target metrics
  - Risk level: Medium (affects automatic scaling)

- `restart_daemonset` - Restart DaemonSet pods across nodes
  - Use case: Node-level issues, system component failures
  - Implementation: Rolling restart of DaemonSet, ensure coverage
  - Risk level: Medium (affects node-level services)

- `cordon_node` - Mark nodes as unschedulable (without draining)
  - Use case: Node issues, maintenance preparation
  - Implementation: Set node.spec.unschedulable=true
  - Risk level: Low (doesn't affect running pods)

### Database & Stateful Services Actions
- `failover_database` - Trigger database failover to replica
  - Use case: Primary database failures, performance issues
  - Implementation: Promote replica, update service endpoints
  - Risk level: High (data consistency risks)

- `repair_database` - Run database repair/consistency checks
  - Use case: Database corruption, integrity issues
  - Implementation: Execute repair commands, verify consistency
  - Risk level: High (potential data loss)

- `scale_statefulset` - Scale StatefulSets with proper ordering
  - Use case: Database scaling, ordered service scaling
  - Implementation: Scale with proper startup/shutdown order
  - Risk level: Medium (affects stateful services)

### Monitoring & Observability Actions
- `enable_debug_mode` - Enable debug logging temporarily
  - Use case: Troubleshooting, performance analysis
  - Implementation: Update log levels, enable profiling
  - Risk level: Low (performance impact)

- `create_heap_dump` - Trigger memory dumps for analysis
  - Use case: Memory leaks, performance troubleshooting
  - Implementation: Execute dump commands, collect files
  - Risk level: Low (temporary performance impact)

### Resource Management Actions
- `optimize_resources` - Intelligently adjust resource requests/limits
  - Use case: Resource efficiency, cost optimization
  - Implementation: Analyze usage patterns, update resources
  - Risk level: Medium (can cause OOM or throttling)

- `migrate_workload` - Move workloads to different nodes/zones
  - Use case: Node pressure, zone failures
  - Implementation: Cordon nodes, trigger pod eviction, schedule elsewhere
  - Risk level: Medium (service disruption during migration)

- `compact_storage` - Trigger storage compaction operations
  - Use case: Storage fragmentation, performance issues
  - Implementation: Execute database compaction, defragmentation
  - Risk level: Medium (performance impact during operation)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Read-only operations, protective actions, reversible changes
- **Medium Risk**: Operations affecting single services, reversible with effort
- **High Risk**: Cluster-wide changes, data operations, service mesh modifications

### Implementation Priority
1. **Storage & Persistence** - Direct business impact
2. **Security & Compliance** - Regulatory requirements
3. **Application Lifecycle** - Operational efficiency
4. **Monitoring & Observability** - Troubleshooting capabilities
5. **Network & Connectivity** - Complex but necessary
6. **Database & Stateful Services** - Highest risk, most specialized

### Technical Considerations
- Each action requires extensive testing with fake clients
- SLM prompt needs updates to include new actions
- Validation logic must be extended
- Documentation and runbooks required
- Rollback procedures for high-risk actions
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all K8s client methods
- Integration tests with fake Kubernetes API
- End-to-end tests with real SLM recommendations
- Chaos engineering tests for failure scenarios
- Performance testing for resource-intensive operations

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize actions based on business requirements
2. Implement in small batches (3-5 actions per phase)
3. Extensive testing before production deployment
4. Gradual rollout with monitoring
5. Collect metrics and feedback for optimization
