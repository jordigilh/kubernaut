## 📋 **Service Overview**

### **What Is Effectiveness Monitor Service?**

The Effectiveness Monitor Service is Kubernaut's **performance assessment engine** that evaluates the effectiveness of executed remediation actions through multi-dimensional analysis.

**Core Purpose**:
- Assess how well remediation actions actually solved problems (BR-INS-001)
- Correlate actions with environmental improvements (BR-INS-002)
- Track long-term effectiveness trends (BR-INS-003)
- Detect adverse side effects (BR-INS-005)
- Enable continuous improvement through feedback loops (BR-INS-010)

**Why It Exists**:
Without effectiveness monitoring, Kubernaut would be "flying blind" - executing remediations without knowing if they actually work, which actions consistently succeed, or which cause problems.

## 🏗️ **Hybrid Architecture**

**Design Decision**: [DD-EFFECTIVENESS-001: Hybrid Automated + AI Analysis Approach](../../architecture/decisions/DD-EFFECTIVENESS-001-Hybrid-Automated-AI-Analysis.md)

### **Two-Level Assessment**

The Effectiveness Monitor uses a **hybrid approach** combining automated checks (always) with selective AI-powered analysis (high-value cases only).

#### **Level 1: Automated Assessment** (Always Executed)
- **Implementation**: GO service
- **Scope**:
  - Health checks (pod running, OOM errors, latency metrics)
  - Metric comparisons (pre/post execution)
  - Component audit events (health, alert, alert_decay, metrics, spec-hash); DataStorage computes weighted effectiveness score on demand
  - Alert decay detection with multi-probe cross-validation: keeps EA open when all non-alert probes (health, metrics, hash) are positive but the alert is still firing due to Prometheus lookback window decay. Health is re-probed live on each decay pass; metrics score is checked but not re-probed. If any probe turns negative, the decay hypothesis is killed and the alert is accepted at face value. Covers both reactive signals (health as ground truth) and proactive/predictive signals (metrics as ground truth). (Issue #369, BR-EM-012)
  - Anomaly detection (metric changes > thresholds)
- **Cost**: Negligible (computational only)
- **Latency**: <100ms
- **Volume**: Every workflow (~3.67M/year)

#### **Level 2: AI-Powered Analysis** (Selective Execution)
- **Implementation**: Calls HolmesGPT API `POST /api/v1/postexec/analyze`
- **Scope**:
  - Root cause validation ("problem solved" vs "problem masked")
  - Oscillation detection ("fix A caused problem B")
  - Pattern learning (context-aware effectiveness)
  - Lesson extraction (for Context API)
- **Cost**: ~$9K/year (LLM API costs)
- **Latency**: 2-5s (async, doesn't block workflow status updates)
- **Volume**: ~18,000/year (0.5% of workflows)

#### **Decision Triggers** (When AI Analysis is Called)

| Trigger | Volume/Year | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **P0 Failures** | ~3,650 | Learn from critical failures to prevent recurrence |
| **New Action Types** | ~2,600 | Build pattern library for new actions |
| **Suspected Oscillations** | ~1,825 | Detect "fix A caused problem B" scenarios |
| **Periodic Batch** | ~10,000 | Long-term trend analysis, predictive insights |
| **Routine Successes** | 0 (skip) | No learning value, waste of cost |

**Cost/Benefit**: $9K/year investment for $100K+ value (11x ROI)
- Achieves 85-90% remediation effectiveness (vs 70% current)
- Reduces cascade failures from 30% to <10%
- Enables continuous pattern learning

## 🏗️ **Service Architecture**

### **Service Position in V1**

```
WorkflowExecution CRD (completed) → Effectiveness Monitor (8080)
                                    ↓ (5-min stabilization delay)
                                    ├→ Data Storage (8080)
                                    ├→ External Prometheus (9090)
                                    └→ HolmesGPT API (8080) [selective]
                                    ↓
                                    Context API (8080) → Notifications (8080)
```

**Data Flow** (Hybrid Approach):
1. **WorkflowExecution** completes → CRD status = "completed"
2. **Effectiveness Monitor Controller** watches WorkflowExecution CRDs → detects completion (< 1s)
3. **Idempotency Check**: Database lookup via WorkflowExecution.UID → skip if already assessed
4. **Assessment Scheduled**: Record created with **5-minute stabilization delay**
5. **After 5 Minutes** → **Effectiveness Monitor** performs **automated assessment**:
   - Retrieves action history from Data Storage (90-day window)
   - Queries metrics from External Prometheus (before/after comparison)
   - Health checks (pod running, OOM errors, restart count)
   - Metric comparisons (latency, CPU, memory, network)
   - Basic effectiveness scoring (0-1 scale)
   - Anomaly detection (unexpected side effects)
6. **Effectiveness Monitor** makes **decision**: `shouldCallAI()?`
   - P0 failure? → YES (~50/day)
   - New action type? → YES (~10/day)
   - Anomaly detected? → YES (~5/day)
   - Oscillation/recurring failure? → YES (~5/day)
   - Routine success? → NO (~10,000/day)
7. **IF YES** → **Effectiveness Monitor** calls **HolmesGPT API**:
   - `POST /api/v1/postexec/analyze`
   - Root cause validation (was diagnosis correct?)
   - Oscillation detection (repeating failures?)
   - Pattern learning (similar scenarios?)
   - Lesson extraction (what to do differently?)
8. **Effectiveness Monitor** stores **combined results**:
   - Automated metrics (always) → Data Storage PostgreSQL
   - AI lessons (when analyzed) → Context API for future use
9. **Context API** uses effectiveness data for future recommendations

**Key Timing**: WorkflowExecution completion → Assessment complete = **~5-6 minutes total**

### **Dependencies**

| Dependency | Port | Purpose | V1 Status |
|------------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Data Storage Service** | 8080 | Action history, vector DB, effectiveness storage | ✅ V1 |
| **External Prometheus** | 9090 | Metrics scraping, side effect detection | ✅ V1 |
| **HolmesGPT API** | 8090 | AI-powered post-execution analysis (selective) | ✅ V1 |
| **Intelligence Service** | 8080 | Advanced pattern discovery (optional) | 🔴 V2 |

**Result**: ✅ All required dependencies available in V1 (Intelligence Service is optional)

**Integration Pattern**: Effectiveness Monitor calls HolmesGPT API selectively (~18K/year) for intelligent analysis

## 🎯 **V1.0 Level 1 vs V1.1 Level 2**

### **Level 1 (V1.0): Day-1 Value**

Level 1 automated assessment provides immediate value from the first remediation:
- Dual spec hash capture, health checks via K8s API, pre/post metric comparison via Prometheus
- Alert resolution check via AlertManager; EM emits component audit events; DataStorage computes weighted effectiveness score on demand
- Side-effect detection; EM always emits Normal `EffectivenessAssessed` K8s event on completion
- **No data dependency**: Works from Day 1 without historical accumulation

### **Level 2 (V1.1): 8+ Weeks Post V1.0**

Level 2 AI-powered analysis (HolmesGPT PostExec) requires historical patterns:
- HolmesGPT PostExec analysis, pattern learning, batch processing
- Requires 8+ weeks of Level 1 assessment data for high-confidence analysis (80%+)
- BR-INS-003, BR-INS-004, BR-INS-006 to BR-INS-010

### **Example Responses**

**Level 1 (V1.0)** — Emitted as `effectiveness.assessment.completed` audit event from Day 1:
```json
{
  "event_type": "effectiveness.assessment.completed",
  "effectiveness_score": 0.88,
  "signal_resolved": true,
  "health_checks": { "pod_running": true, "readiness_pass": true },
  "metric_deltas": { "cpu_before": 0.95, "cpu_after": 0.92 },
  "side_effects_detected": []
}
```

**Level 2 (V1.1)** — Enriched with AI analysis when 8+ weeks of data available:
```json
{
  "effectiveness_score": 0.88,
  "pattern_insights": ["Similar actions successful in 87% of production cases"],
  "lessons_learned": [...],

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Pyramid**
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Business logic, assessment algorithms, pattern recognition
- **Integration Tests** (>50%): Data Storage integration, Infrastructure Monitoring queries, microservices coordination
- **E2E Tests** (10%): Complete assessment flow from action execution to result
- **Rationale**: Effectiveness monitoring requires extensive integration with Data Storage and Infrastructure Monitoring services

### **Key Test Scenarios**
1. ✅ Effectiveness assessment with sufficient data (Week 13+)
2. ✅ Graceful degradation with insufficient data (Week 5)
3. ✅ Side effect detection (CPU spike, memory leak)
4. ✅ Trend analysis (improving, declining, stable)
5. ✅ Temporal pattern detection (business hours vs off-hours)
6. ✅ Seasonal variation detection (Q1 vs Q4)

**Test Location**: `test/unit/ai/insights/`, `test/integration/ai/insights/`
