- `handlers.InvestigatingHandler`: HolmesGPT-API integration
- `status.investigationSummary`: RCA summary from LLM

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ HolmesGPT-API called with complete signal + enrichment context
- ✅ Investigation results stored in `status.investigationSummary`
- ✅ Root cause analysis captured with evidence chain

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: `test/unit/aianalysis/handlers/investigating_handler_test.go`
- Integration: `test/integration/aianalysis/holmesgpt_integration_test.go`
- E2E: Full investigation flow with real HolmesGPT-API

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/investigating.go:316-384`

#### BR-AI-002: Support Multiple Analysis Types

**Status**: ⏸️ **DEFERRED TO v2.0**
**Authority**: [DD-AIANALYSIS-005](../../../architecture/decisions/DD-AIANALYSIS-005-multiple-analysis-types-deferral.md) - Multiple Analysis Types Feature Deferral

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST support multiple analysis types (diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) through HolmesGPT-API.

**Priority**: ~~P1 (HIGH)~~ → Deferred to v2.0 (Jan 2026)

**Rationale**: Different alert types require different investigation approaches. Diagnostic analysis identifies current issues, while predictive/prescriptive provide future guidance.

**v1.x Reality**:
- ⚠️ Feature **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - `AnalysisTypes` field exists but is ignored by controller
- ✅ Single analysis type supported per request
- ❌ Multiple values in `AnalysisTypes` array are ignored
- See [DD-AIANALYSIS-005](../../../architecture/decisions/DD-AIANALYSIS-005-multiple-analysis-types-deferral.md) for full analysis

**v1.x Implementation**:
- Controller makes exactly 1 HAPI call per reconciliation
- Endpoint determines analysis type (incident/recovery/postexec)
- Tests MUST use single-value `AnalysisTypes` arrays

**Deferred To v2.0**:
- Multiple analysis types in single request
- Diagnostic vs predictive vs prescriptive categorization
- Pending business requirement validation

**v1.x Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Single incident analysis
- ✅ Single recovery analysis
- ✅ Workflow selection from single analysis

---

#### BR-AI-003: Structured Analysis Results with Confidence Scoring

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST generate structured analysis results with confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for recommendation quality assessment.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Confidence scores enable automated approval routing (high confidence → auto-approve, low confidence → manual review).

**Implementation**:
- `status.selectedWorkflow.confidence`: Workflow selection confidence
- `status.approvalRequired`: Set based on confidence threshold (default 80%, configurable via Rego policy — #225)
- `metrics.RecordConfidenceScore()`: Track confidence distribution

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0
- ✅ `approvalRequired = true` when confidence < threshold (default 80%, configurable via `input.confidence_threshold` — #225)
- ✅ Metrics track confidence distribution by signal type

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: `test/unit/aianalysis/handlers/analyzing_handler_test.go`
- Integration: Confidence threshold triggering

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/analyzing.go:57-134`
- `pkg/aianalysis/metrics/metrics.go`

**Related ADRs**: ADR-018 (Approval Notification Integration)

---

#### BR-AI-007: Generate Actionable Remediation Recommendations

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST generate actionable remediation recommendations based on alert context, selecting from predefined workflow catalog.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Workflow recommendations must be executable (not theoretical) with concrete parameters for RemediationOrchestrator/WorkflowExecution.

**Implementation**:
- `status.selectedWorkflow.workflowId`: Catalog lookup key
- `status.selectedWorkflow.containerImage`: OCI image reference
- `status.selectedWorkflow.parameters`: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE workflow parameters
- `status.selectedWorkflow.rationale`: LLM reasoning

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Workflow selected from predefined catalog (via MCP tool)
- ✅ Parameters use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
- ✅ Container image reference included for execution

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: Workflow selection logic
- Integration: HolmesGPT MCP tool integration
- E2E: End-to-end workflow selection and execution

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/investigating.go:316-384`
- `status.selectedWorkflow` population

**Related DDs**: DD-CONTRACT-001, DD-WORKFLOW-003

---

#### BR-AI-012: Root Cause Analysis with Supporting Evidence

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST identify root cause candidates with supporting evidence from HolmesGPT investigation.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Root cause identification enables targeted remediation and prevents treating symptoms instead of causes.

**Implementation**:
- `status.investigationSummary`: RCA summary from HolmesGPT
- `status.evidenceChain`: Supporting evidence list
- `status.affectedResource`: Identified problematic resource

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Root cause identified with evidence chain

**Related ADRs**: ADR-041 (LLM Response Contract)

---

#### BR-AI-076: Approval Context for Low Confidence

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST populate comprehensive `approvalContext` when confidence is below the configured threshold (default 80%, configurable via Rego policy — #225), providing operators with sufficient information to make informed approval decisions.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Low-confidence recommendations require human review. Rich approval context reduces approval latency and improves decision quality. Per ADR-018, approval miss rate target is <5%.

**Implementation**:
- `status.approvalRequired`: Boolean flag for approval routing
- `status.approvalReason`: Human-readable explanation
- `status.approvalContext.confidence`: Numeric confidence value
- `status.approvalContext.investigationSummary`: Brief RCA summary
- `status.approvalContext.evidenceCollected`: Supporting evidence list
- `status.approvalContext.alternativesConsidered`: Other workflow options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ `approvalRequired = true` when confidence < threshold (default 80% — #225)
- ✅ `approvalReason` explains why approval needed
- ✅ `approvalContext` includes investigation summary
- ✅ Evidence and alternatives provided for review

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: Approval context population logic
- Integration: Confidence threshold triggering
- E2E: Approval workflow with rich context

**Related ADRs**: ADR-018 (Approval Notification Integration), ADR-040 (RemediationApprovalRequest)

---

### Category 3: Approval Policies

#### BR-AI-028: Auto-Approve or Flag for Manual Review

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST evaluate Rego approval policies to determine if workflow execution requires manual approval or can proceed automatically.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: High-confidence, low-risk workflows should auto-execute for MTTR reduction. Low-confidence or high-risk workflows require human review for safety.

**Implementation**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/rego/evaluator.go`: Rego policy engine
- `/etc/kubernaut/policies/approval.rego`: Approval policy file
- `status.approvalRequired`: Boolean flag for routing decision
- `status.approvalReason`: Human-readable explanation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Rego policy evaluates confidence, risk, environment
- ✅ `approvalRequired` set based on policy decision
- ✅ `approvalReason` explains why approval needed

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: `test/unit/aianalysis/rego_evaluator_test.go` (26 tests)
- Integration: `test/integration/aianalysis/rego_integration_test.go`
- E2E: Approval routing end-to-end

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/rego/evaluator.go:155-217`
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/analyzing.go:57-134`

**Related DDs**: DD-AIANALYSIS-002 (Rego Policy Startup Validation)
**Related ADRs**: ADR-050 (Configuration Validation Strategy)

---

#### BR-AI-029: Rego Policy Evaluation

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST support Rego policy evaluation for approval decisions with startup validation and hot-reload capabilities.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Rego policies enable flexible, declarative approval rules that can be updated without code changes. Startup validation prevents production errors.

**Implementation**:
- `cmd/aianalysis/main.go:128-135`: Startup validation (fail-fast)
- `pkg/aianalysis/rego/evaluator.go`: Hot-reload with graceful degradation
- `pkg/shared/hotreload/FileWatcher`: ConfigMap hot-reload support
- Policy hash logging for observability

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Invalid policy prevents pod startup (fail-fast per ADR-050)
- ✅ Hot-reload updates apply without pod restart
- ✅ Invalid hot-reload preserves old policy (graceful degradation)
- ✅ Compiled policy cached (71-83% latency reduction)

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: `test/unit/aianalysis/rego_startup_validation_test.go` (8 tests)
  - Startup validation: valid/invalid policy
  - Hot-reload: graceful degradation
  - Performance: cached policy compilation
- Integration: Rego policy evaluation with real policies

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/rego/evaluator.go` (217 lines)
- `cmd/aianalysis/main.go:128-138` (startup validation)

**Related DDs**: DD-AIANALYSIS-002 (Rego Policy Startup Validation)
**Related ADRs**: ADR-050 (Configuration Validation Strategy)

---

#### BR-AI-030: Policy-Based Routing Decisions

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST support policy-based routing decisions for approval workflows, considering confidence, risk level, and environment context.

**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)

**Rationale**: Different environments (production vs. staging) and risk levels require different approval thresholds. Rego policies enable flexible, environment-aware routing.

**Implementation**:
- Rego policy input includes:
  - `confidence`: Workflow selection confidence
  - `environment`: Production, staging, development
  - `riskLevel`: High, medium, low
  - `signalType`: Alert type (OOMKilled, CrashLoop, etc.)
- Policy output: `approvalRequired` boolean

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Rego policy receives complete context for decision
- ✅ Environment-aware approval thresholds (prod strict, staging lenient)
- ✅ Risk-based routing (high-risk always requires approval)

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: Policy evaluation with various input combinations
- Integration: Environment-specific approval routing

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/rego/evaluator.go` (policy input construction)
- `/etc/kubernaut/policies/approval.rego` (policy logic)

---

### Category 4: Recovery Flow

#### BR-AI-080: Track Previous Execution Attempts

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST track previous execution attempts when analyzing recovery scenarios, providing historical context for learning.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Failed workflows indicate initial RCA may have been incorrect or incomplete. Recovery investigations benefit from knowing what was already tried.

**Implementation**:
- `spec.isRecoveryAttempt`: Boolean flag
- `spec.recoveryAttemptNumber`: Attempt count (1, 2, 3...)
- `spec.previousExecutions[]`: Array of previous attempts with failure reasons

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Recovery attempts tracked in spec
- ✅ Previous failure reasons passed to HolmesGPT-API
- ✅ Attempt number increments on each recovery

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: Recovery context validation
- Integration: Recovery flow with multiple attempts
- E2E: Complete recovery cycle

**Implementation Files**:
- `api/aianalysis/v1alpha1/aianalysis_types.go` (spec fields)
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/investigating.go` (recovery context handling)

**Related DDs**: DD-RECOVERY-002 (Direct AIAnalysis Recovery Flow)

---

#### BR-AI-081: Pass Failure Context to LLM

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST pass failure context from previous execution attempts to HolmesGPT-API for improved recovery investigation.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: LLM can learn from previous failures to suggest alternative workflows or identify missed root causes.

**Implementation**:
- `spec.previousExecutions[].failureReason`: Why workflow failed
- `spec.previousExecutions[].failurePhase`: Which phase failed (validation, execution, verification)
- `spec.previousExecutions[].kubernetesReason`: K8s-specific failure reason
- Recovery context sent to HolmesGPT-API `/api/v1/investigate` endpoint

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Failure context included in HolmesGPT-API request
- ✅ LLM receives structured failure information
- ✅ Recovery investigation considers previous attempts

**Test Coverage**:
- Integration: Recovery request with failure context
- E2E: Failed workflow → recovery → alternative workflow selected

**Implementation Files**:
- `pkg/aianalysis/handlers/investigating.go` (recovery request building)
- `pkg/aianalysis/client/holmesgpt.go` (API client)

**Related ADRs**: ADR-045 (AIAnalysis ↔ HolmesGPT-API Contract)

---

#### BR-AI-082: Historical Context for Learning

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST maintain historical context across recovery attempts to enable learning and pattern recognition.

**Priority**: P1 (HIGH)

**Rationale**: Multiple recovery attempts indicate persistent or complex issues. Historical context helps identify patterns and systemic problems.

**Implementation**:
- `spec.previousExecutions[]`: Immutable history of all attempts
- Each entry captures: workflow used, parameters, failure reason, timestamp
- Audit trail in Data Storage for long-term analysis

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Complete execution history maintained in spec
- ✅ Each attempt includes workflow details and outcome
- ✅ Audit events enable historical analysis

**Test Coverage**:
- Integration: Multiple recovery attempts tracked
- E2E: Recovery cycle with 3+ attempts

**Implementation Files**:
- `api/aianalysis/v1alpha1/aianalysis_types.go` (previousExecutions array)
- `pkg/aianalysis/audit/audit.go` (audit event recording)

**Related DDs**: DD-AUDIT-002 (Audit Shared Library Design)

---

#### BR-AI-083: Recovery Investigation Flow

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST support direct recovery investigation flow where RemediationOrchestrator creates new AIAnalysis CRD for recovery attempts.

**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

**Rationale**: Direct recovery flow (RO → AIAnalysis) is simpler than self-recovery and provides fresh investigation context. Per DD-RECOVERY-002, this is the V1.0 approach.

**Implementation**:
- RemediationOrchestrator creates new AIAnalysis CRD when WorkflowExecution fails
- New AIAnalysis includes `isRecoveryAttempt = true` and previousExecutions history
- HolmesGPT-API receives recovery context for alternative workflow selection
- Process repeats until success or max attempts reached

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ RemediationOrchestrator creates AIAnalysis for recovery
- ✅ Recovery context passed through spec fields
- ✅ Alternative workflows selected on recovery attempts

**Test Coverage**:
- E2E: Complete recovery flow (WE fails → RO creates AA → alternative workflow selected)

**Implementation Files**:
- RemediationOrchestrator creates AIAnalysis (external to AA service)
- AIAnalysis handles recovery investigation transparently

**Related DDs**: DD-RECOVERY-002 (Direct AIAnalysis Recovery Flow)

#### BR-AI-084: Proactive Signal Mode Prompt Strategy

**Priority**: P1 (High)
**GitHub Issue**: [#55](https://github.com/jordigilh/kubernaut/issues/55)
**Full Document**: [docs/requirements/BR-AI-084-proactive-signal-mode-prompt-strategy.md](../../../requirements/BR-AI-084-proactive-signal-mode-prompt-strategy.md)

**Description**: AIAnalysis MUST pass `SignalMode` (from SP via RO) to HAPI and HAPI MUST adapt its prompt strategy based on whether the signal is `reactive` or `proactive`. Proactive signals require environment evaluation instead of RCA.

**Acceptance Criteria**: See [dedicated BR document](../../../requirements/BR-AI-084-proactive-signal-mode-prompt-strategy.md#acceptance-criteria).

**Related**: BR-SP-106, DD-WORKFLOW-001
