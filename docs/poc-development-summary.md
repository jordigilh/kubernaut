- **Context Optimization**: Maintained accuracy while expanding from 4k to 16k token contexts

**Performance Testing Results**:

*Comprehensive Model Comparison (16k/8k/4k context tokens):*

**Granite 3.1-Dense:2b Performance**:
- **Average Confidence**: 0.91 (consistently 0.90+ across all context sizes)
- **Average Response Time**: 13.50s
- **Success Rate**: 100% (3/3 tests)
- **Action Diversity**: 
  - 16k tokens: `scale_deployment` (confidence: 0.92)
  - 8k tokens: `optimize_resources` (confidence: 0.90)
  - 4k tokens: `optimize_resources` (confidence: 0.90)

**Granite 3.3:2b Performance**:
- **Average Confidence**: 0.85 (consistent but lower than 3.1-dense)
- **Average Response Time**: 13.79s
- **Success Rate**: 100% (3/3 tests)
- **Action Consistency**: `increase_resources` recommended across all context sizes (confidence: 0.85)

**Key Performance Insights**:
- **Context Size Impact**: Minimal performance degradation across 16k/8k/4k tokens for both models
- **Model Superiority**: Granite 3.1-Dense:2b outperformed 3.3:2b in confidence (+7%) and speed (+2%)
- **Decision Quality**: 3.1-Dense showed better action variety, indicating more nuanced analysis
- **Consistency**: Both models maintained stable performance regardless of context window size

**Recommendation**: Use Granite 3.1-Dense:2b for production deployments

**LLM Advantage**: Single prompt handles scenarios that would require hundreds of rules in traditional systems

## Phase 4: Oscillation Prevention & MCP Integration (Days 7-9)

### Intelligent Action History Analysis

  - Scale oscillations (thrashing between scale up/down)
  - Ineffective loops (repeated failed actions)
  - Cascading failure patterns

**MCP Integration Benefits**:
- **Real-time Context**: SLM queries live database for recent actions before deciding
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies oscillation patterns humans might miss
- **Adaptive Behavior**: System learns from past failures automatically

**Development Time**: 3 days vs **Estimated 6-8 weeks** for building equivalent pattern detection rules

**Technical Achievement**: Stored Procedures Architecture
- Moved complex SQL queries from code to database
