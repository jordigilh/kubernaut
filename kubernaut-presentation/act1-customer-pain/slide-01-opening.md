### Title
**"The $11.2M Problem: Why Kubernetes Operations Are Breaking Teams"**

### Opening Story

> *"It's 3 AM. Your customer's production Kubernetes cluster is down."*
>
> *"CrashLoopBackOff errors are cascading. Prometheus is firing 200+ alerts. CloudWatch shows database connection timeouts. The on-call engineer is manually reading logs, checking Git history, and SSHing into nodes."*
>
> *"45 minutes later, they find the issue: A memory leak caused OOMKilled pods."*
>
> *"The fix? A simple resource limit adjustment and rolling restart."*
>
> *"**Something AI could have detected and fixed in under 5 minutes.**"*

## üìä Key Statistics

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Impact** |
|---|---|---|
| **Average MTTR** | **60 minutes** | Manual investigation + fix |
| **Downtime Cost** | **$5,000-$9,000/min** | **Example: $300K-$540K per 60-min incident** |
| **Engineer Toil** | 40% time on repetitive work | Manual incident response (Google SRE Book) |
| **Alert Growth** | 10x faster than team growth | Unsustainable scaling model |

## üí¨ Customer Quote

> *"We're hiring SREs faster than we can scale our Kubernetes clusters. Every new service means more alerts, more incidents, and more burnout. **We need automation that actually works.**"*

## üé® Visual Recommendations

**Option 1: Dark Background with Spotlight**
- Single engineer at laptop in the dark
- Time: 3:00 AM (clock display)
- Screen showing Kubernetes dashboard with red alerts

**Option 2: Split Screen**
- Left: Engineer exhausted, multiple alerts firing
- Right: Same scenario with Kubernaut (sleeping engineer, AI fixing issue)

**Option 3: Timeline**
- 00:00 - Alert fires
- 00:02 - Engineer woken up
- 00:45 - Manual fix complete
- Next slide: "What if it took 2 minutes instead?"

## üéØ Key Takeaway

> **"This is happening to your customers RIGHT NOW. Engineers are burning out. Companies are losing millions. Manual operations don't scale."**
