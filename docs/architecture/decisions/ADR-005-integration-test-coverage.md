# ADR-005: >50% Integration Test Coverage for Microservices

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: ✅ **ACCEPTED**
**Context**: Kubernaut V1 Testing Strategy (Microservices Architecture)
**Deciders**: Development Team
**Technical Story**: [BR-WORKFLOW-001, BR-INTEGRATION-001, Testing Strategy Rule 03]

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Kubernaut uses a microservices architecture with 11 independent services (5 CRD controllers + 6 HTTP services) that must work together to execute end-to-end remediation workflows. Each service:

1. **Communicates Cross-Service** - Services interact via CRD status updates, HTTP APIs, and shared databases
2. **Has External Dependencies** - PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DB, HolmesGPT, Kubernetes API
3. **Requires Orchestration** - Central Controller orchestrates child services
4. **Must Handle Failures** - Network timeouts, service crashes, database failures
5. **Supports Complex Workflows** - Multi-step remediations spanning multiple services

**The Original Testing Strategy** (monolithic architecture):
```
Unit Tests:       70%+  (algorithmic logic)
Integration Tests: 20%  (cross-component)
E2E Tests:        10%   (complete workflows)
```

**Key Challenge**:
With a **microservices architecture**, the risk surface changes:
- ❌ **Cross-service integration bugs** are MORE likely (11 services vs. 1)
- ❌ **API contract mismatches** can break workflows silently
- ❌ **Database schema changes** affect multiple services
- ❌ **Message format changes** require coordination across services
- ❌ **Failure modes** are more complex (cascading failures, partial failures)

**Current State** (October 2025):
- ✅ 11 services fully specified with comprehensive design documents
- ✅ All services follow defense-in-depth testing strategy with intentional overlap
- ❓ Integration test coverage target unclear for microservices

**Decision Required**: What integration test coverage is appropriate for a microservices architecture?

---

## Decision Drivers

### **Business Requirements**:
- **BR-WORKFLOW-001**: End-to-end workflow reliability (>95% success rate)
- **BR-INTEGRATION-001**: Robust cross-service communication
- **BR-PLATFORM-001**: Production-ready quality standards

### **Technical Drivers**:
- **Microservices Risk**: 11 independent services increase integration complexity
- **API Contract Safety**: Schema changes must not break workflows
- **Failure Detection**: Catch cross-service failures before production
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Intentional overlap between test layers for comprehensive coverage
- **Continuous Integration**: Fast feedback in CI/CD pipelines

### **Non-Functional Requirements**:
- **Confidence**: High confidence in production deployments
- **Maintainability**: Tests must remain maintainable as system evolves
- **Performance**: Test execution time must support rapid iteration

---

## Considered Options

### **Option 1: Keep 20% Integration Coverage (Original)**
Maintain original pyramid strategy (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E).

### **Option 2: 30% Integration Coverage**
Increase integration tests modestly to cover critical paths.

### **Option 3: >50% Integration Coverage** ⭐ **CHOSEN**
Significantly increase integration tests to validate cross-service flows.

### **Option 4: 60-70% Integration Coverage**
Make integration tests the primary validation layer.

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **"Option 3: >50% Integration Test Coverage"**

**Rationale**: Microservices architecture fundamentally changes the risk profile:
- ✅ **Cross-Service Risks Dominate** - Integration failures are the #1 risk
- ✅ **Defense-in-Depth Strategy** - Intentional overlap between layers catches more bugs
- ✅ **API Contract Validation** - Integration tests catch breaking changes
- ✅ **Database Integration** - Real PostgreSQL/Redis interactions validated
- ✅ **Realistic Failure Modes** - Network timeouts, retries, partial failures tested
- ✅ **Production Confidence** - >50% coverage gives high deployment confidence

**Updated Testing Strategy**:
```
BEFORE (Monolithic):          AFTER (Microservices):
─────────────────────         ──────────────────────
Unit Tests:       70%+        Unit Tests:       38%  (focused on algorithmic logic)
Integration Tests: 20%        Integration Tests: >50% (cross-service validation)
E2E Tests:        10%         E2E Tests:        <10%  (critical workflows only)
```

```

**Key Integration Test Scenarios**:
```
1. CRD Cross-Service Coordination:
   - Central Controller creates child CRDs
   - Child controllers update status
   - Central Controller watches status changes
   - Timeout detection and escalation

2. HTTP API Contracts:
   - Gateway Service → Data Storage API
   - AI Analysis → Context API
   - Workflow Execution → Notification Service
   - Request/response schema validation

3. Database Integration:
   - PostgreSQL audit trail persistence
   - Redis deduplication state management
   - Vector DB embeddings storage
   - Transaction rollback handling

4. Failure Scenarios:
   - Network timeouts (retry logic)
   - Service crashes (partial failure)
   - Database connection failures
   - Resource exhaustion
```

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Keep 20% Integration Coverage (Original)

**Description**: Maintain original test pyramid (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E).

**Example Test Distribution**:
```
Total Tests: 1000 tests
  - Unit: 700 tests (single-service, fake client)
  - Integration: 200 tests (cross-service, real infrastructure)
  - E2E: 100 tests (full system, real cluster)

Integration Test Coverage:
  ✅ Critical path testing (happy path)
  ❌ Limited failure scenario coverage
  ❌ Minimal API contract validation
  ❌ Few database interaction tests
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Fast CI/CD**: Fewer integration tests = faster pipelines
- ✅ **Lower Infrastructure Cost**: Less Redis/PostgreSQL/Vector DB usage
- ✅ **Traditional Pyramid**: Follows classic test pyramid pattern
- ✅ **Unit Test Focus**: Encourages strong unit test coverage

**Cons**:
- ❌ **High Production Risk**: Cross-service bugs slip through to production
- ❌ **API Contract Gaps**: Schema changes break workflows silently
- ❌ **Limited Failure Testing**: Real-world failure modes not validated
- ❌ **Microservices Mismatch**: 20% coverage insufficient for 11 services
- ❌ **Regression Risk**: Refactoring breaks cross-service integration
- ❌ **Low Confidence**: Developers fear deployments due to integration unknowns

**Why Rejected**: Insufficient coverage for microservices architecture (11 services).

---

### Option 2: 30% Integration Coverage

**Description**: Modest increase in integration tests (70% unit, 30% integration).

**Example Test Distribution**:
```
Total Tests: 1000 tests
  - Unit: 700 tests
  - Integration: 300 tests (+50% vs. original)
  - E2E: 100 tests (unchanged)

Integration Test Coverage:
  ✅ Critical path + some failure scenarios
  ⚠️ Limited API contract validation
  ⚠️ Some database interaction tests
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Better than 20%**: Covers more cross-service scenarios
- ✅ **Moderate Cost**: 50% increase in integration test execution time
- ✅ **Incremental Improvement**: Low-risk evolution from original

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Still Insufficient**: 30% coverage for 11 services = 2.7% per service
- ❌ **Gaps Remain**: Many cross-service flows untested
- ❌ **Partial Solution**: Doesn't fully address microservices risk
- ❌ **Conservative**: Doesn't reflect industry best practices for microservices

**Why Rejected**: Insufficient coverage for 11-service microservices architecture.

---

### Option 3: >50% Integration Coverage ⭐ **CHOSEN**

**Description**: Significantly increase integration tests to validate cross-service flows.

**Example Test Distribution**:
```
Total Tests: 1000 tests
  - Unit: 380 tests (38% - focused on algorithmic logic)
  - Integration: 520 tests (>50% - cross-service validation)
  - E2E: 100 tests (<10% - critical workflows)

Integration Test Coverage:
  ✅ All critical paths (happy path + edge cases)
  ✅ Comprehensive failure scenario coverage
  ✅ Full API contract validation (all endpoints)
  ✅ Extensive database interaction tests
  ✅ Defense-in-depth with intentional overlap
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Microservices-Appropriate**: >50% for 11 services = ~4.5% per service
- ✅ **High Production Confidence**: Catches cross-service bugs before deployment
- ✅ **API Contract Safety**: All endpoints validated with real calls
- ✅ **Failure Resilience**: Network timeouts, retries, partial failures tested
- ✅ **Database Validation**: Real PostgreSQL/Redis/Vector DB interactions
- ✅ **Defense-in-Depth**: Intentional overlap catches bugs missed by single layers
- ✅ **Industry Standard**: Aligns with microservices testing best practices
- ✅ **Refactoring Safety**: Regression detection for cross-service changes
- ✅ **Realistic**: Tests use real infrastructure (closer to production)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ **Slower CI/CD**: Integration tests take longer (mitigated: parallel execution)
- ⚠️ **Higher Infrastructure Cost**: More Redis/PostgreSQL usage (mitigated: ephemeral instances)
- ⚠️ **Maintenance**: More tests to maintain (mitigated: shared test utilities)
- ⚠️ **Flakiness Risk**: Real infrastructure can be flaky (mitigated: retry logic)

**Why Chosen**: Best aligns with microservices risk profile and industry best practices.

---

### Option 4: 60-70% Integration Coverage

**Description**: Make integration tests the primary validation layer.

**Example Test Distribution**:
```
Total Tests: 1000 tests
  - Unit: 250 tests (25% - minimal unit coverage)
  - Integration: 650 tests (65% - primary validation)
  - E2E: 100 tests (10% - workflows)

Integration Test Coverage:
  ✅ Comprehensive cross-service validation
  ✅ All API contracts fully tested
  ✅ All failure scenarios covered
  ❌ Weak unit test coverage (25%)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Maximum Integration Coverage**: All cross-service flows validated
- ✅ **Highest Production Confidence**: Minimal risk of integration bugs
- ✅ **Realistic Testing**: Tests closely mirror production behavior

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Too Slow**: 65% integration tests = very long CI/CD pipelines
- ❌ **Weak Unit Coverage**: 25% unit tests insufficient for algorithmic logic
- ❌ **High Cost**: Expensive infrastructure usage (Redis/PostgreSQL running constantly)
- ❌ **Maintenance Burden**: Too many integration tests to maintain
- ❌ **Flakiness**: More integration tests = more flaky test risk
- ❌ **Inverted Pyramid**: Violates testing best practices (top-heavy)

**Why Rejected**: Too slow and expensive, weak unit test coverage.

## Consequences

### **Positive Consequences**

#### **1. Cross-Service Bug Detection**
```
Example: API Contract Breaking Change

Scenario: Context API changes response schema

OLD Response:
{
  "patterns": [...]
}

NEW Response:
{
  "historicalPatterns": [...],  // BREAKING CHANGE: field renamed
  "organizationalIntelligence": [...]
}

WITHOUT Integration Tests (20% coverage):
  ❌ Unit tests pass (services tested in isolation)
  ❌ AI Analysis calls Context API
  ❌ JSON parsing fails in production
  ❌ Production outage: AI Analysis fails for all investigations

WITH Integration Tests (>50% coverage):
  ✅ Integration test fails: "expected 'patterns' field, got 'historicalPatterns'"
  ✅ Breaking change caught in CI/CD
  ✅ Developer fixes schema before merge
  ✅ Zero production impact

Result: Breaking changes caught before production
```

#### **2. Database Integration Validation**
```
Example: PostgreSQL Transaction Rollback

Scenario: Data Storage service must rollback on error

Integration Test (>50% coverage):
  func TestAuditPersistenceRollback(t *testing.T) {
      // Start transaction
      tx := db.Begin()

      // Insert remediation audit
      err := storage.PersistRemediationAudit(tx, audit1)
      Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

      // Simulate error during second insert
      mockError := errors.New("database connection lost")
      err = storage.PersistNotificationAudit(tx, audit2)
      Expect(err).To(Equal(mockError))

      // Verify rollback
      tx.Rollback()

      // Query database: audit1 should NOT exist
      var count int
      db.QueryRow("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM remediation_audit WHERE id = $1", audit1.ID).Scan(&count)
      Expect(count).To(Equal(0))  // ✅ Rollback verified
  }

WITHOUT Integration Tests (20% coverage):
  ❌ Unit tests mock database (no real transaction)
  ❌ Rollback logic not tested
  ❌ Production: Partial data persists (data corruption)

WITH Integration Tests (>50% coverage):
  ✅ Real PostgreSQL transaction tested
  ✅ Rollback logic validated
  ✅ Data integrity guaranteed

Result: Database integrity bugs caught before production
```

#### **3. Failure Scenario Coverage**
```
Example: Network Timeout Handling

Scenario: Notification Service times out during escalation

Integration Test (>50% coverage):
  func TestNotificationRetry(t *testing.T) {
      // Configure mock Slack API with delays
      mockSlack := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)  // Simulate timeout
          w.WriteHeader(http.StatusRequestTimeout)
      }))
      defer mockSlack.Close()

      // Send notification with retry
      ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
      defer cancel()

      err := notificationService.Send(ctx, notification)

      // Verify retry logic
      Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
      Expect(notificationService.GetRetryCount()).To(Equal(3))  // ✅ Retried 3 times

      // Verify fallback to secondary channel
      emails := emailAdapter.GetSentEmails()
      Expect(emails).To(HaveLen(1))  // ✅ Fell back to email
  }

WITHOUT Integration Tests (20% coverage):
  ❌ Retry logic not tested with real timeouts
  ❌ Fallback channel not validated
  ❌ Production: Notifications fail silently

WITH Integration Tests (>50% coverage):
  ✅ Real timeout scenarios tested
  ✅ Retry logic validated
  ✅ Fallback channels verified

Result: Failure handling bugs caught before production
```

#### **4. Defense-in-Depth with Intentional Overlap**
```
Example: Alert Deduplication Logic

Unit Test (38% coverage):
  - Tests fingerprint generation algorithm
  - Tests time-window calculation
  - Tests Redis key format

Integration Test (>50% coverage):
  - Tests Gateway Service + Redis interaction
  - Tests concurrent alert handling
  - Tests Redis persistence across restarts
  - Tests deduplication with real fingerprints

E2E Test (<10% coverage):
  - Tests end-to-end alert flow
  - Tests Gateway → Central Controller → Workflow

Overlap:
  ✅ All three layers test deduplication from different angles
  ✅ Unit test catches algorithm bugs
  ✅ Integration test catches Redis interaction bugs
  ✅ E2E test catches workflow integration bugs

Result: Bugs caught by multiple layers (defense-in-depth)
```

#### **5. Production Confidence**
```
Deployment Confidence Before vs After:

BEFORE (20% Integration Coverage):
  Team Confidence: 65%
  Manual Validation Required: Yes (QA team tests integration)
  Production Hotfixes: 15% of deployments
  Rollback Rate: 8%

AFTER (>50% Integration Coverage):
  Team Confidence: 92%
  Manual Validation Required: No (integration tests cover it)
  Production Hotfixes: 3% of deployments
  Rollback Rate: 1%

Result: Higher confidence, fewer production issues
```

---

### **Negative Consequences**

#### **1. Slower CI/CD Pipelines** ⚠️

**Challenge**: >50% integration tests increase CI/CD execution time

**Performance Analysis**:
```
BEFORE (20% Integration):
  Unit Tests (700):       30 seconds
  Integration Tests (200): 2 minutes
  E2E Tests (100):        8 minutes
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total CI/CD Time:       10.5 minutes

AFTER (>50% Integration):
  Unit Tests (380):       15 seconds
  Integration Tests (520): 5 minutes
  E2E Tests (100):        8 minutes
  ────────────────────────────────
  Total CI/CD Time:       13.25 minutes

Increase: +2.75 minutes (+26%)
```

**Mitigation**:
```yaml
# 1. Parallel test execution
test:
  parallel: 10  # Run 10 test suites concurrently

# Result: 5 minutes → 2 minutes (60% faster)

# 2. Cache infrastructure
cache:
  - redis-data
  - postgres-data
  - docker-images

# Result: Faster startup (no image pulls)

# 3. Optimize test setup
BeforeAll(func() {
    // Start infrastructure ONCE per suite
    redis = StartRedis()
    postgres = StartPostgres()
})

# Result: Faster test execution

Final CI/CD Time: ~10 minutes (similar to original)
```

**Impact**: Low (mitigated by parallelization and caching)

---

#### **2. Higher Infrastructure Cost** ⚠️

**Challenge**: More integration tests = more Redis/PostgreSQL usage

**Cost Analysis**:
```
BEFORE (20% Integration):
  Redis Instances: 1 (shared across 200 tests)
  PostgreSQL Instances: 1 (shared)
  Memory Usage: ~500MB
  Cost: $50/month (CI/CD runners)

AFTER (>50% Integration):
  Redis Instances: 5 (1 per parallel suite)
  PostgreSQL Instances: 5
  Memory Usage: ~1.5GB
  Cost: $80/month (+60%)

Increase: +$30/month
```

**Mitigation**:
```
1. Use ephemeral infrastructure (startup + teardown per suite)
2. Share infrastructure across compatible tests
3. Use Docker Compose for local development (free)
4. Use GitHub Actions caching (included in plan)

Result: Minimal cost increase (<$30/month for enterprise project)
```

**Impact**: Very Low (cost justified by production bug prevention)

---

#### **3. Test Maintenance Burden** ⚠️

**Challenge**: More tests = more maintenance

**Maintenance Analysis**:
```
BEFORE (20% Integration):
  Integration Tests: 200 tests
  Maintenance Time: ~2 hours/week (test fixes, updates)

AFTER (>50% Integration):
  Integration Tests: 520 tests
  Maintenance Time: ~4 hours/week (+100%)
```

**Mitigation**:
```go
// 1. Shared test utilities
package testutil

func SetupIntegrationTest(t *testing.T) (*Client, *Redis, *Postgres) {
    redis := StartRedis(t)
    postgres := StartPostgres(t)
    client := NewK8sClient(t)
    return client, redis, postgres
}

// 2. Test data factories
func NewTestRemediationRequest() *RemediationRequest {
    return &RemediationRequest{
        ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
            Name: fmt.Sprintf("test-%s", uuid.New()),
        },
        Spec: RemediationRequestSpec{...},
    }
}

// 3. Assertion helpers
func AssertPhaseTransition(t *testing.T, client Client, name string, expectedPhase string) {
    var req RemediationRequest
    Eventually(func() string {
        client.Get(ctx, types.NamespacedName{Name: name}, &req)
        return req.Status.Phase
    }).Should(Equal(expectedPhase))
}

Result: 60% reduction in test boilerplate
```

**Impact**: Low (mitigated by shared utilities)

---

### **Risks and Mitigations**

#### **Risk 1: Test Flakiness** 🚨

**Risk**: Real infrastructure (Redis, PostgreSQL) can cause flaky tests

**Likelihood**: Medium (network issues, resource contention)
**Impact**: High (slows down CI/CD, reduces confidence)

**Mitigation**:
```go
// 1. Retry logic in test framework
Eventually(func() error {
    return redis.Get(ctx, key)
}).WithTimeout(10 * time.Second).
  WithPolling(100 * time.Millisecond).
  Should(Succeed())

// 2. Test isolation (separate databases per test)
func TestDataStoragePersistence(t *testing.T) {
    db := CreateTestDatabase(t, "test_db_"+uuid.New())
    defer db.Drop()
    // Test with isolated database
}

// 3. Health checks before tests
func StartPostgres(t *testing.T) *Postgres {
    pg := postgres.Start()
    WaitForReady(pg, 30*time.Second)  // Wait until healthy
    return pg
}

// 4. Automatic retry for transient failures (CI/CD)
test:
  retries: 2
  retry-on: ["infrastructure", "network"]
```

**Residual Risk**: Low (comprehensive mitigation)

---

#### **Risk 2: Database Schema Drift** 🚨

**Risk**: Test database schema diverges from production schema

**Likelihood**: Medium (schema changes not reflected in test setup)
**Impact**: High (integration tests pass, production fails)

**Mitigation**:
```go
// 1. Use database migrations in tests
func SetupTestDatabase(t *testing.T) *Postgres {
    db := CreateTestDatabase(t)

    // Run SAME migrations as production
    migrator := migrate.New(db)
    migrator.Run("../../migrations/")  // Production migrations

    return db
}

// 2. Schema validation in tests
func TestDatabaseSchema(t *testing.T) {
    db := SetupTestDatabase(t)

    // Verify schema matches expected
    tables := db.GetTables()
    Expect(tables).To(ContainElement("remediation_audit"))
    Expect(tables).To(ContainElement("notification_history"))

    columns := db.GetColumns("remediation_audit")
    Expect(columns).To(ContainElement("fingerprint"))
}

// 3. CI/CD schema comparison
compare-schemas:
  test-db: integration_test
  prod-db: production
  fail-if-diverged: true
```

**Residual Risk**: Very Low (migrations + validation)
