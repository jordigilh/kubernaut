fix(test): Add Flush() before Close() in all integration test suites

ISSUE: Audit store background writer attempts to flush buffered events after
DataStorage has been stopped during test cleanup, causing ~27 seconds of
"connection refused" error logs (no functional impact).

ROOT CAUSE (All Services):
- AfterSuite/SynchronizedAfterSuite calls auditStore.Close()
- Infrastructure (DataStorage) stopped immediately after Close()
- Background writer retries failed writes for ~27s (exponential backoff: 1s, 4s, 16s)
- Each retry logs "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:PORT: connect: connection refused"

SOLUTION APPLIED (Option A - 95% confidence):
Add explicit Flush() with 10-second timeout BEFORE Close() in all services.
This ensures all buffered audit events are written to DataStorage before
infrastructure stops, preventing connection refused errors.

SERVICES FIXED (6 total):

1. WorkflowExecution (test/integration/workflowexecution/suite_test.go)
   - Added WE-SHUTDOWN-001: Flush -> Close -> Stop infrastructure
   - Timeout: 10 seconds for flush operation
   - Reference: WE_DATASTORAGE_CONNECTION_REFUSED_TRIAGE_JAN_04_2026.md

2. AIAnalysis (test/integration/aianalysis/suite_test.go)
   - Added AA-SHUTDOWN-001: Flush -> Close -> Stop infrastructure
   - Replaced time.Sleep(1s) with explicit Flush(10s timeout)
   - Same pattern as WE for consistency

3. SignalProcessing (test/integration/signalprocessing/suite_test.go)
   - Added SP-SHUTDOWN-001: Flush -> Close -> Stop infrastructure
   - Timeout: 10 seconds for flush operation

4. RemediationOrchestrator (test/integration/remediationorchestrator/suite_test.go)
   - Added RO-SHUTDOWN-001: Flush -> Close -> Stop infrastructure
   - Previously missing audit store cleanup entirely
   - Now properly flushes and closes before infrastructure stop

5. Notification (test/integration/notification/suite_test.go)
   - Added NT-SHUTDOWN-001: Flush -> Close -> Stop infrastructure
   - Timeout: 10 seconds for flush operation

6. HolmesGPT API (holmesgpt-api/tests/integration/conftest.py)
   - Added HAPI-SHUTDOWN-001: flush(timeout=10.0) -> close()
   - Python fixture cleanup in audit_store fixture
   - Same pattern as Go services

PATTERN (Consistent Across All Services):

Go services (BeforeSuite/SynchronizedAfterSuite):

    if auditStore != nil {
        By("Flushing audit store before infrastructure shutdown")
        
        flushCtx, flushCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
        defer flushCancel()

        err := auditStore.Flush(flushCtx)  // Explicit flush FIRST
        if err != nil {
            GinkgoWriter.Printf("Warning: Failed to flush: %v\n", err)
        } else {
            GinkgoWriter.Println("Audit store flushed (all buffered events written)")
        }

        err = auditStore.Close()  // Then close
        // ...
    }

    // ... cancel(), testEnv.Stop(), etc ...

    // Safe to stop infrastructure now - events already flushed
    err = infrastructure.StopServiceIntegrationInfrastructure(GinkgoWriter)

Python service (pytest fixture cleanup):

    if store.flush(timeout=10.0):
        print("Audit store flushed (all buffered events written)")
    else:
        print("Warning: Audit store flush timed out or failed")

    store.close()

BENEFITS:
- Clean logs: No "connection refused" errors during cleanup
- Explicit control: Flush timing is deterministic (not dependent on Close())
- Graceful shutdown: Follows best practices
- Consistent pattern: All 6 services use same approach
- +10s to test suite: Acceptable trade-off for clean logs

VALIDATION:
- No lint errors in any modified files
- Pattern tested in WE (triage analysis confirmed root cause)
- All services use BufferedAuditStore with Flush() support
- Gateway not affected (doesn't use audit store)

TRACEABILITY:
- Analysis: docs/handoff/WE_DATASTORAGE_CONNECTION_REFUSED_TRIAGE_JAN_04_2026.md
- Pattern: WE-SHUTDOWN-001, AA-SHUTDOWN-001, SP-SHUTDOWN-001, RO-SHUTDOWN-001, NT-SHUTDOWN-001, HAPI-SHUTDOWN-001
- Authority: Graceful shutdown best practices for buffered systems
