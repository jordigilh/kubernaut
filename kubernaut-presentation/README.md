## 🎨 Rendering Diagrams (Mermaid to Images)

All diagrams use **Mermaid** syntax. To convert them to images for Google Docs:

### **Option 1: Online (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://mermaid.live/
2. Copy/paste Mermaid code from markdown files
3. Click "Export" → PNG or SVG
4. Download and insert into Google Docs

### **Option 2: VS Code Extension**
1. Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
2. Open `.md` file in VS Code
3. Preview markdown (Cmd+Shift+V / Ctrl+Shift+V)
4. Right-click diagram → Copy/Save as image

### **Option 3: CLI (Batch Processing)**
```bash
# Install mermaid-cli
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Render single diagram
mmdc -i slide-04-market-segmentation.md -o diagram.png

# Batch render all diagrams
find . -name "*.md" -exec mmdc -i {} -o {}.png \;
```

3. Import HTML to Google Docs
