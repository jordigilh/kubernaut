# DD-HOLMESGPT-008: Safety-Aware Investigation Pattern

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED
**Decision Maker**: Architecture Team
**Confidence**: 95%

---

## 📋 **Context**

The HolmesGPT API service initially included a separate `/api/v1/safety/analyze` endpoint for validating action safety before execution. This approach had several limitations:

1. **Double LLM Cost**: Required 2 LLM calls (investigate + safety)
2. **Context Loss**: Separate calls lost contextual information
3. **Increased Latency**: Sequential calls added 2-4 seconds
4. **Complexity**: Maintained 2 endpoints for overlapping functionality
5. **Suboptimal Recommendations**: Two-step process limited LLM intelligence

---

## 🎯 **Decision**

**Remove the `/api/v1/safety/analyze` endpoint and embed safety context directly into the investigation prompt.**

### **Implementation**

1. **RemediationProcessor** enriches context with safety information
2. **AIAnalysis Controller** includes safety context in investigation prompt
3. **LLM** analyzes incident WITH full safety awareness
4. **Recommendations** are inherently safe and context-aware
5. **WorkflowExecution** validates recommendations using Rego policies

---

## 🔄 **Alternatives Considered**

### **Alternative 1: Keep Separate Safety Endpoint**

**Approach**: Maintain `/api/v1/safety/analyze` as independent endpoint

**Pros**:
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Dedicated safety validation
- ✅ Explicit safety checks

**Cons**:
- ❌ 2× LLM cost ($0.50 → $1.00 per investigation)
- ❌ Context loss between calls
- ❌ 2-4 seconds additional latency
- ❌ More complex API surface
- ❌ Suboptimal recommendations (LLM doesn't see safety in investigation)

**Cost Impact**:
- 3.65M investigations/year × $1.00 = **$3.65M/year**

**Decision**: ❌ **REJECTED** - Prohibitive cost and context loss

---

### **Alternative 2: Post-Investigation Filtering**

**Approach**: Let LLM recommend freely, filter unsafe actions afterward

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Single LLM call
- ✅ Fast

**Cons**:
- ❌ Wastes LLM analysis on unsafe actions
- ❌ No alternative suggestions
- ❌ Requires re-investigation for rejected actions
- ❌ Poor user experience (recommendations get blocked)

**Decision**: ❌ **REJECTED** - Inefficient, wastes LLM capacity

---

### **Alternative 3: Safety-Aware Investigation (Selected)**

**Approach**: Embed safety context in investigation prompt

**Pros**:
- ✅ 1× LLM cost ($0.0387 per investigation with self-doc JSON)
- ✅ Full context in single prompt
- ✅ 1.5-2.5 seconds latency (60% token reduction)
- ✅ LLM makes holistic, safety-aware decisions
- ✅ Simpler API surface (1 endpoint)
- ✅ Higher quality recommendations

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Prompt engineering required
- ⚠️ RemediationProcessor must provide complete safety context

**Cost Impact** (Updated with DD-HOLMESGPT-009 token optimization):
- 3.65M investigations/year × $0.0387 = **$1,412,550/year**
- **Savings**: $2,237,450/year vs $3.65M/year (61.3% reduction)
- **Token Efficiency**: 290 input tokens (vs 800 verbose) = 63.75% reduction

**Decision**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Optimal cost/quality trade-off
