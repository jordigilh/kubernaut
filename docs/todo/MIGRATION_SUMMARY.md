# docs/todo Migration Summary

**Date**: January 2025
**Migration**: HTTP-based architecture ‚Üí CRD-based architecture
**Authority**: MULTI_CRD_RECONCILIATION_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## üìä CHANGES SUMMARY

### **Architecture Alignment**
- **Previous**: 14 services, HTTP/REST communication, investigation vs execution separation
- **Current**: 10 services, CRD-based reconciliation, alert-processing focus
- **Authority**: MULTI_CRD_RECONCILIATION_ARCHITECTURE.md (approved, 98% confidence)

### **Timeline Update**
- **Previous**: 3-4 weeks for 14 services
- **Current**: 8 weeks for CRD implementation
- **Justification**: CRD framework, controllers, and reconciliation loops require additional development time

---

## ‚ùå SERVICES REMOVED FROM V1

The following services were **removed** as they are NOT part of V1 CRD architecture:

### **1. Environment Classifier Service (Port 8082)**
**Reason**: Integrated into Alert Processor Service as in-process component
**Business Requirements**: BR-ENV-001 to BR-ENV-050 now handled within Alert Processor
**Impact**: No separate service needed, reduces complexity

### **2. Intelligence Engine Service (Port 8087)**
**Status**: Moved to stateless support (Port 8086, no CRD)
**Reason**: Works on historical data, not live alert processing - does not require CRD
**Implementation**: HTTP wrapper for pattern discovery (3-4 hours)

### **3. Context API Service (Port 8089)**
**Status**: Moved to stateless support (Port 8091, no CRD)
**Reason**: Pure data serving, no state to reconcile
**Implementation**: HTTP wrapper for context retrieval (2-3 hours)

### **4. Monitoring Service (Port 8091)**
**Status**: Renamed to Infrastructure Monitoring Service (Port 8094, no CRD)
**Reason**: Aggregate metrics collection, not alert-specific state
**Implementation**: HTTP wrapper with CRD metrics (2-3 hours)

---

## ‚úÖ SERVICES UPDATED FOR CRD ARCHITECTURE

### **Services WITH CRD + Reconciliation Controllers (4)**

#### **1. Alert Processor Service (Port 8081)**
**CRD**: AlertProcessing
**Controller**: AlertProcessingReconciler

**Phases**: `enriching ‚Üí classifying ‚Üí routing ‚Üí completed`
**Integration**: Environment classification now in-process component

#### **2. AI Analysis Service (Port 8082)**
**CRD**: AIAnalysis
**Controller**: AIAnalysisReconciler
**Change**: Added CRD schema and reconciliation phases requirement
**Phases**: `investigating ‚Üí analyzing ‚Üí recommending ‚Üí completed`

#### **3. Workflow Service (Port 8083)**
**CRD**: WorkflowExecution
**Controller**: WorkflowExecutionReconciler
**Change**: Added CRD schema and reconciliation phases requirement
**Phases**: `planning ‚Üí validating ‚Üí executing ‚Üí monitoring ‚Üí completed`

#### **4. Kubernetes Executor Service (Port 8084)**
**CRD**: KubernetesExecution
**Controller**: KubernetesExecutionReconciler
**Change**: Added CRD schema and reconciliation phases requirement
**Phases**: `validating ‚Üí executing ‚Üí verifying ‚Üí completed`

### **Central Coordination (NEW - CRITICAL)**

#### **5. AlertRemediation Central Controller**
**CRD**: AlertRemediation
**Controller**: AlertRemediationController
**Status**: **NEW CRITICAL COMPONENT** - Must implement first
**Key Features**:
- Watches ALL 4 service CRDs (event-driven)
- Duplicate alert handling (BR-WH-008)
- Timeout management (BR-ALERT-006, default: 1h)
- 24-hour retention + cleanup
- Audit persistence verification

### **Stateless Services WITHOUT CRDs (6)**

1. **Gateway Service (8080)** - Creates CRDs, no reconciliation
2. **Data Storage Service (8085)** - Infrastructure persistence
3. **HolmesGPT-API Service (8090)** - Investigation only
4. **Context Service (8091)** - Context serving
5. **Intelligence Service (8086)** - Pattern analysis
6. **Infrastructure Monitoring Service (8094)** - System metrics
7. **Notification Service (8089)** - Message delivery

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES

### **New Phase 0: CRD Framework (Week 1)**
**Added**: Kubebuilder setup, controller-runtime installation, development environment
**Reason**: CRD implementation requires framework and tooling setup

### **Updated Phases**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 2-3)**: Central AlertRemediation controller (was not in previous version)
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5)**: AlertProcessing + AIAnalysis CRDs (sequential implementation)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 6-7)**: WorkflowExecution + KubernetesExecution CRDs (parallel development)
- **Phase 4 (Week 8)**: Production readiness (expanded from 1 week to include CRD-specific validation)

### **Key Additions**

#### **Duplicate Alert Handling (BR-WH-008)**
- Fingerprint-based duplicate detection in Gateway
- Update existing AlertRemediation CRD (no new processing)
- Alert storm escalation (5+ duplicates)
- Environment/severity-specific notifications

#### **Timeout Management (BR-ALERT-006)**
- Configurable remediation timeout (default: 1h)
- Automatic timeout detection in reconciliation
- Escalation to appropriate teams
- Notification channels by environment/severity

#### **24-Hour CRD Lifecycle**
- CRDs retained for 24h after completion (configurable)
- Automatic cleanup to prevent cluster resource accumulation
- Audit persistence verification before deletion
- Dual audit system (CRD temporary + Database permanent)

#### **Watch-Based Status Aggregation**
- Event-driven status updates (not polling)
- <1s latency for status changes
- AlertRemediation controller watches ALL service CRDs
- Reduced API server load
