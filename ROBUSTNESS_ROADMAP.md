# Production Robustness Roadmap - Prometheus Alerts SLM

**Current Status**: Functional PoC with comprehensive testing  
**Goal**: Production-ready automated Kubernetes remediation system  
**Priority**: Critical gaps ‚Üí Enhancement features ‚Üí Advanced capabilities

## Executive Summary

Based on the current PoC implementation and our Granite model performance analysis, this roadmap outlines the path to production robustness. The system currently has a solid foundation with excellent SLM integration and comprehensive testing, but needs several critical enhancements for production deployment.

## Current State Assessment ‚úÖ

### What's Working Well
- ‚úÖ **Core SLM Integration**: Excellent Granite 3.1 model integration with proven accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Basic Actions**: Core remediation actions implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Actions**: High-priority actions (rollback, quarantine, drain_node, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and model performance testing
- ‚úÖ **Model Selection**: Clear guidance on Dense 2B as optimal production choice
- ‚úÖ **Kubernetes Integration**: Solid K8s client implementation with fake testing
- ‚úÖ **Webhook Processing**: AlertManager webhook handling and parsing
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration

### Current Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Action Set**: Only 9 actions vs. 24 planned in FUTURE_ACTIONS.md
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Circuit Breakers**: Missing failure protection mechanisms
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Basic Observability**: Limited metrics and monitoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Rate Limiting**: Potential for action storms
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Simple Error Handling**: Basic retry logic only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Action History**: Missing audit trail and rollback capabilities

## Critical Path to Production (Priority 1) üö®

### 1. Safety & Reliability Mechanisms

#### Circuit Breakers & Rate Limiting
```go
// Implement action circuit breakers
type ActionCircuitBreaker struct {
    maxFailures    int
    timeWindow     time.Duration
    cooldownPeriod time.Duration
}

// Rate limiting per action type
type ActionRateLimiter struct {
    actionsPerMinute map[string]int
    globalLimit      int
}
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Action-specific circuit breakers (prevent action storms)
- [ ] Global rate limiting (max actions per minute/hour)
- [ ] Exponential backoff for failed actions
- [ ] Emergency stop mechanism (manual override)
- [ ] Action cooling-off periods per resource

#### Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] **Structured error types** with severity levels
- [ ] **Action validation** before execution (pre-flight checks)
- [ ] **Rollback mechanisms** for failed actions
- [ ] **Alert escalation** when automated actions fail
- [ ] **Human intervention triggers** for critical failures

#### Action History & Audit Trail
- [ ] **Action execution logging** with full context
- [ ] **Decision justification tracking** (SLM reasoning storage)
- [ ] **Action outcome tracking** (success/failure with details)
- [ ] **Rollback chain tracking** (what can be undone)
- [ ] **Compliance audit reports** (who, what, when, why)

### 2. Enhanced Observability

#### Prometheus Metrics Expansion
```go
// Current + needed metrics
var (
    // Existing
    alertsReceived = prometheus.NewCounterVec(...)
    slmRequests = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(...)
    
    // Critical additions
    actionExecutions = prometheus.NewCounterVec(...)
    actionDuration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(...)
    circuitBreakerState = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(...)
    confidenceScores = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(...)
    modelAccuracy = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(...)
)
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Action-specific metrics** (execution count, duration, success rate)
- [ ] **Model performance metrics** (confidence distribution, accuracy tracking)
- [ ] **System health metrics** (circuit breaker state, rate limits)
- [ ] **Business impact metrics** (resources affected, cost impact)
- [ ] **SLA compliance metrics** (response time, availability)

#### Structured Logging Enhancement
- [ ] **Correlation IDs** across alert ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí action ‚Üí outcome
- [ ] **Semantic logging** with structured fields for alerting/analytics
- [ ] **Log aggregation** integration (ELK, Splunk, etc.)
- [ ] **Sensitive data filtering** (no secrets in logs)
- [ ] **Performance logging** for optimization insights

### 3. Configuration & Deployment Robustness

#### Environment-Specific Configuration
```yaml
# Production configuration template
production:
  slm:
    model: "granite3.1-dense:2b"  # Based on our performance analysis
    confidence_threshold: 0.85
    timeout: 5s
  actions:
    dry_run: false
    max_concurrent: 3
    cooldown_period: "5m"
    circuit_breaker:
      failure_threshold: 5
      reset_timeout: "30m"
  rate_limits:
    global_actions_per_hour: 100
    per_action_per_hour: 20
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Environment-specific configs** (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] **Configuration validation** at startup
- [ ] **Hot configuration reload** (without restart)
- [ ] **Secret management** integration (Vault, K8s secrets)
