|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 112 | `cmd/webhook-service/` | ‚ùå MISSING | Directory doesn't exist |
| 114 | `docker/webhook-service.Dockerfile` | ‚ùå MISSING | File doesn't exist (10 other Dockerfiles exist) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **TERMINOLOGY INCONSISTENCIES**

### Issue 2: Alert vs Signal Terminology

**Problem**: README uses "Alert" terminology extensively despite ADR-015 multi-signal migration

| Line | Current Text | Issue | Recommended Fix |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| 37 | "Independent alert processing" | Inconsistent | "Independent signal processing" |
| 153 | "Alert Processor" | Deprecated | "Signal Processor" |
| 255 | "Alert Processing & Execution" | Deprecated | "Signal Processing & Execution" |
| 320 | "Receives Prometheus alerts" | Too specific | "Receives signals (alerts, events, alarms)" |
| 321 | "Alert Processor: Filters and processes incoming alerts" | Deprecated | "Signal Processor: Processes multiple signal types" |
| 606 | "Alert Processing" | Deprecated | "Signal Processing" |
| 612 | "Alert Ingestion" | Deprecated | "Signal Ingestion" |
| 613 | "alert investigations" | Deprecated | "signal investigations" |

**Evidence**: 
- Line 3: Intro correctly mentions "multiple signal types"
- Lines 204-245: "Multi-Signal Data Flow" section uses correct terminology
- Lines 141-202: System Architecture diagram uses "Alert Processor" (inconsistent)

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Confuses new developers about multi-signal capability

**Reference**: [ADR-015: Alert to Signal Naming Migration](docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-015-alert-to-signal-naming-migration.md)

---

### Issue 3: Microservices Architecture Mismatch

**Problem**: Lines 36-41 reference old microservice names that don't align with V1 architecture

| Line | Current Text | V1 Architecture Says | Issue |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 37 | "üîó Webhook Service" | Gateway Service | Name mismatch |
| 38 | "üß† Context API Service" | Not in V1 core 10 | Unclear status |
| 39 | "ü§ñ AI Service" | Not in V1 core 10 | Unclear status |
| 40 | "‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Engine Service" | WorkflowExecution (CRD Controller) | Architecture confusion |
| 41 | "üíæ Data Service" | Not in V1 core 10 | Unclear status |

**V1 Core Services** (per [KUBERNAUT_SERVICE_CATALOG.md](docs/architecture/KUBERNAUT_SERVICE_CATALOG.md)):
1. Gateway Service
2. RemediationProcessor Service (CRD Controller)
3. AIAnalysis Service (CRD Controller)
4. WorkflowExecution Service (CRD Controller)
5. KubernetesExecutor Service (CRD Controller)
6. RemediationOrchestrator Service (CRD Controller)
7. Effectiveness Monitor Service
8. Notification Service
9. Intelligence Pattern Service
10. (To be determined)

**Impact**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Misrepresents actual V1 architecture

---

### Issue 4: Service Communication Diagram Outdated

**Problem**: Lines 51-59 show old service communication architecture

```
AlertManager ‚Üí webhook-service:8080 ‚Üí ai-service:8093 (planned)
```

**V1 Architecture** (per [MULTI_CRD_RECONCILIATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/MULTI_CRD_RECONCILIATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)):
```
Signal Source ‚Üí Gateway Service (RemediationRequest CRD) ‚Üí 
RemediationProcessor ‚Üí AIAnalysis ‚Üí WorkflowExecution ‚Üí KubernetesExecutor ‚Üí 
RemediationOrchestrator
```

**Impact**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Fundamental architecture misrepresentation

---

## üìä **MODERATE ISSUES**

### Issue 5: Phase 1 Claims Don't Match V1 Architecture

**Problem**: Lines 43-49 claim "Phase 1 Complete: Webhook Service" but V1 architecture shows CRD-based design

**Claims** (Lines 43-49):
- ‚úÖ "Phase 1 Complete: Webhook Service"
- "TDD Implementation: Complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle"
- "Docker Image: Red Hat UBI9 Go toolset"
- "Production-ready manifests with HPA"

**V1 Reality**:
- Gateway Service creates RemediationRequest CRD
- CRD Controllers (not standalone services) perform processing
- No evidence of completed webhook-service implementation in cmd/

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Creates confusion about implementation status

---

### Issue 6: System Architecture Diagram Uses Old Terminology

**Problem**: Lines 141-202 (Mermaid diagram) uses "Alert Processor", "PROC[Alert Processor]"

**Should Be**: "Signal Processor" or "RemediationProcessor Service"

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Visual inconsistency with multi-signal architecture

---

### Issue 7: Duplicate "For Developers - Start Here" Sections

**Problem**: Lines 5-30 and 675-693 both have developer guidance sections

| Location | Title | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Lines 5-30 | "V1 Architecture & Design - START HERE" | Links to 5 authoritative docs |
| Lines 675-693 | "For Developers - Start Here" | Links to same 3 docs (subset) |

**Impact**: üü° **LOW** - Minor redundancy, but confusing

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **MINOR ISSUES**

### Issue 8: Python References Without Multi-Language Clarification

**Problem**: Lines 94, 663, references to Python don't clarify it's for HolmesGPT integration only

**Lines**:
- 94: "Go + Python hybrid system"
- 663: "Python: PEP 8 compliance"

**Reality**: Kubernaut is primarily Go; Python is for HolmesGPT (external service)

**Impact**: üü¢ **INFO** - Minor clarification needed

---

### Issue 9: Docker Compose Deprecated But Still Prominently Featured

**Problem**: Lines 411-424 show Docker Compose as "Option 2" despite deprecation

**Better Approach**: Move to appendix or remove entirely, keep only Kind cluster

**Impact**: üü¢ **INFO** - Minor priority issue

---

## ‚úÖ **STRENGTHS**

1. **Excellent V1 Architecture Section** (Lines 5-30)
   - Links to all 5 authoritative Tier 1 documents
   - Clear hierarchy explanation
   - Quality assurance reference

2. **Multi-Signal Emphasis** (Line 3, Lines 204-245)
   - Correctly emphasizes multi-signal capability
   - Good sequence diagram showing signal types

3. **Comprehensive Action List** (Lines 337-383)
   - Well-organized by category
   - Clear descriptions

4. **Good Developer Workflow** (Lines 472-521)
   - Clear testing instructions
   - Code examples

---
