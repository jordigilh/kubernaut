## üìã **REMAINING TASKS - PRIORITY ORDER**

### **PHASE 2: MODERATE PRIORITY RULE CLEANUP**

#### **Task 1: Clean Rule 09 (Interface Method Validation)**
**Current Status**: 690 lines - Very verbose with repetitive validation patterns
**Target**: ~80 lines
**Priority**: HIGH (affects development workflow)

**Key Issues to Address**:
- Massive redundancy in validation examples
- Buried essential interface validation commands
- Over-explanation of reusability patterns

**Expected Content**:
```markdown
# Interface Method Validation

## Pre-Usage Validation - MANDATORY
**Command**: `./scripts/validate-interface-usage.sh MethodName`
**Rule**: Check existing implementations before creating new

## Reusability Requirements
- Search existing patterns: `codebase_search "existing interface implementations"`
- Use existing mocks from `pkg/testutil/mocks/`
- Avoid duplicate interface definitions

## Validation Triggers
- Before ANY interface method calls
- After interface modifications
- During code reviews

## Anti-Patterns - FORBIDDEN
- Creating new interfaces without checking existing
- Duplicating mock implementations
- Ignoring existing reusable patterns
```

#### **Task 2: Clean Rule 13 (Conflict Resolution Matrix)**
**Current Status**: 476 lines - Verbose decision trees and examples
**Target**: ~60 lines
**Priority**: MEDIUM (used for rule conflicts)

**Key Issues to Address**:
- Lengthy decision tree explanations
- Redundant conflict resolution examples
- Over-detailed automation scripts

**Expected Content**:
```markdown
# Conflict Resolution Matrix

## Priority Hierarchy - MANDATORY
1. **Integration** (Rules 00/07/11) - Overrides all
2. **TDD Methodology** (Rules 03/11/12) - Controls timing
3. **Component-Specific** (Rules 02/04/05/12) - Technical implementation
4. **Quality Assurance** (Rules 06/08/09) - Post-development

## Automated Resolution
**Command**: `./scripts/resolve-rule-conflict.sh Rule1 Rule2 context`

## Common Conflicts
- Integration vs Speed ‚Üí Integration wins
- TDD vs Sophistication ‚Üí TDD timing controls
- AI vs General ‚Üí AI-specific rules win
- Safety vs Speed ‚Üí Safety wins
```

#### **Task 3: Clean Rule 07 (Business Code Integration)**
**Current Status**: 416 lines - Extensive integration patterns and examples
**Target**: ~70 lines
**Priority**: MEDIUM (integration guidance important but covered in Rule 00)

**Key Issues to Address**:
- Redundant integration examples (already in Rule 00)
- Lengthy validation procedures (scripts handle this)
- Over-detailed integration timing (covered in Rule 01)

#### **Task 4: Clean Rule 11 (Development Rhythm)**
**Current Status**: 391 lines - Verbose phase descriptions
**Target**: ~50 lines
**Priority**: MEDIUM (development process guidance)

**Key Issues to Address**:
- Repetitive phase validation scripts
- Over-detailed timing specifications
- Redundant checkpoint explanations

### **PHASE 3: LOWER PRIORITY RULES**

#### **Task 5: Review Smaller Rules**
- Rule 01 (Project Structure): 328 lines ‚Üí Review for essential info only
- Rule 02 (Go Coding Standards): 251 lines ‚Üí Already enhanced, minor cleanup
- Rule 08 (Testing Anti-Patterns): 283 lines ‚Üí May need consolidation
- Rule 04 (AI/ML Guidelines): 147 lines ‚Üí Relatively concise already
- Rule 05 (Kubernetes Safety): 188 lines ‚Üí Check for redundancy
- Rule 06 (Documentation Standards): 191 lines ‚Üí Low priority

#### **Task 6: Consolidation Phase**
- Remove duplicate mock guidance across rules
- Consolidate business requirement references
- Single source of truth for each concept
- Cross-reference cleanup

## üõ†Ô∏è **METHODOLOGY TO FOLLOW**

### **Proven Cleanup Approach**
Based on successful completion of Rules 00, 03, and 12:

1. **Create Backup**: `cp rule.mdc backup-original/`
2. **Identify Core Concepts**: Extract essential MANDATORY/FORBIDDEN guidance
3. **Decision Matrix Format**: Replace prose with tables
4. **Executable Commands**: Replace explanations with scripts
5. **Validate Automation**: Ensure all scripts still work
6. **Test Effectiveness**: Verify violation prevention maintained

### **Content Structure Template**
```markdown
# Rule Title

## Core Requirement - MANDATORY
**Rule**: Single clear statement
**Validation**: `./scripts/validation-command.sh`

## Decision Matrix
| Scenario | Action | Tool |
|----------|--------|------|
| Case A   | Do X   | Script A |
| Case B   | Do Y   | Script B |

## Anti-Patterns - FORBIDDEN
- Specific forbidden action 1
- Specific forbidden action 2

## Commands
- `./scripts/primary-validation.sh`
- `./scripts/specific-check.sh`
```

### **Success Criteria Per Rule**
- **70-90% line reduction** while maintaining effectiveness
- **All automation scripts** remain functional
- **Zero ambiguity** in guidance (clear MANDATORY/FORBIDDEN)
- **Decision matrices** replace lengthy prose
- **Executable commands** for all validation

## üìä **METRICS TO TRACK**

### **Quantitative Goals**
- Total rule lines: Currently ~5,774 ‚Üí Target ~1,500 (75% reduction)
- Automation compatibility: Maintain 100%
- Validation test passage: Maintain 100%

### **Quality Measures**
- Guidance density: Higher ratio of MANDATORY/FORBIDDEN per 100 lines
