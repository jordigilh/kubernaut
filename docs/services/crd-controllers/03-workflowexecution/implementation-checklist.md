## Implementation Checklist

**Note**: Follow APDC-TDD phases for each implementation step (see Development Methodology section)

### Phase 1: ANALYSIS & CRD Setup (2 days) [RED Phase Preparation]

- [ ] **ANALYSIS**: Search existing workflow implementations (`codebase_search "workflow execution implementations"`)
- [ ] **ANALYSIS**: Map business requirements across all 4 BR prefixes:
  - BR-WF-001 to BR-WF-021 (21 BRs): Core workflow management
  - BR-ORCHESTRATION-001 to BR-ORCHESTRATION-010 (10 BRs): Multi-step coordination
  - BR-AUTOMATION-001 to BR-AUTOMATION-002 (2 BRs): Intelligent automation
  - BR-EXECUTION-001 to BR-EXECUTION-002 (2 BRs): Workflow execution monitoring
  - **Total V1 BRs**: 35

### Logging Library

- **Library**: `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log/zap`
- **Rationale**: Official controller-runtime integration with opinionated defaults for Kubernetes controllers
- **Setup**: Initialize in `main.go` with `ctrl.SetLogger(zap.New(zap.UseFlagOptions(&opts)))`
- **Usage**: `log := ctrl.Log.WithName("workflowexecution")`
