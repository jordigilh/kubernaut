**Time**: 30 minutes

**Before**:
```go
EscalationDetails map[string]interface{} `json:"escalationDetails,omitempty"`
```

**After**:
```go
EscalationDetails *EscalationDetails `json:"escalationDetails,omitempty"`

type EscalationDetails struct {
    TimeoutDuration string `json:"timeoutDuration,omitempty"`

## ✅ Low-Priority Issues (5 Total) - RESOLVED

### ISSUE-L01: Effectiveness Monitor Documentation ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Documentation exists and is comprehensive
**Action**: None required (issue report was outdated)

**Documentation Found**:
```
docs/services/stateless/effectiveness-monitor/
├── README.md                      (404 lines)
├── api-specification.md           (612 lines)
├── implementation-checklist.md    (285 lines)

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 8 documents, 4,604 lines
```

**Quality Assessment**: Excellent - all sections complete, aligned with other services

---

### ISSUE-L02: Port Reference Inconsistency ✅ VERIFIED NO ACTION NEEDED
**Status**: ✅ Port strategy is consistent and intentional
**Action**: None required

**Port Strategy** (by design):
| Service Type | Health/API | Metrics | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **CRD Controllers** | 8081 | 8082 | controller-runtime standard |
| **HTTP Services** | 8080 | 9090 | Application API standard |

**Finding**: The "inconsistency" is actually an **intentional architectural decision** to follow framework-specific conventions.

---

### ISSUE-L03: Database Migration Strategy ✅ NOT APPLICABLE
**Status**: ✅ Not needed for V1 (greenfield deployment)
**Action**: None required

**Rationale**:
- ✅ V1 is the **baseline deployment** - no existing database to migrate
- ✅ Initial schema creation scripts already in Data Storage service spec
- ✅ Schema versioning markers in place for future V2 migrations
- ⚠️ Migration strategy WILL be needed after V1 is deployed (for V2+)

---

### ISSUE-L04: Cross-Service Error Handling Standard ✅ CREATED
**Status**: ✅ Comprehensive standard document created
**Document**: `docs/architecture/ERROR_HANDLING_STANDARD.md`
**Size**: 35+ KB, comprehensive coverage

**Standard Includes**:
1. ✅ HTTP error code mapping (4xx, 5xx)
2. ✅ Structured error types (Go implementation)
3. ✅ CRD status error propagation patterns
4. ✅ Retry and timeout standards (per-service budgets)
5. ✅ Circuit breaker configuration
6. ✅ Observability integration (logging, metrics)
7. ✅ Error handling decision matrix
8. ✅ Code examples for all patterns

**Coverage**:
- HTTP services: Standard HTTPError response format
- CRD controllers: ErrorInfo and Condition patterns
- Retry logic: FastRetry, NormalRetry, SlowRetry presets
- Timeouts: Per-service timeout budgets (mapped to operations)
- Circuit breakers: Configuration for external services
- Metrics: Error counters, rates, circuit breaker state

---

### ISSUE-L05: HolmesGPT Testing Strategy ⏸️ DEFERRED TO IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: ⏸️ Defer to AI Analysis service implementation
**Action**: Can clarify during implementation if needed

**Rationale**: Testing strategies already cover integration testing patterns sufficiently. Specific HolmesGPT mocking details can be refined during AI Analysis service implementation.
