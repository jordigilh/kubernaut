2. ✅ Success Rate Aggregation (4 tests)
3. ✅ Namespace Grouping (3 tests)
4. ✅ Severity Distribution (1 test)
5. ✅ Trend Analysis (1 test)

**Total Tests**: 15 tests (4 active, 11 skipped for integration testing)

### GREEN Phase (4h) ✅

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `pkg/contextapi/query/router.go` (~300 lines)

**Methods Implemented**:
1. ✅ `SelectBackend(queryType string) string` - Route queries to appropriate backend
2. ✅ `AggregateSuccessRate(ctx, workflowID) (*SuccessRateResult, error)` - Calculate workflow success rate
3. ✅ `AggregateSuccessRateByAction(ctx, actionType) (*ActionSuccessRate, error)` - Calculate action type success rate
4. ✅ `GroupByNamespace(ctx) (map[string]int, error)` - Group incidents by namespace
5. ✅ `GetSeverityDistribution(ctx, namespace) (map[string]int, error)` - Calculate severity distribution
6. ✅ `GetIncidentTrend(ctx, days int) ([]TrendPoint, error)` - Calculate incident trend over time

**Implementation Highlights**:
- ✅ All queries use `remediation_audit` table (architectural correctness)
- ✅ Read-only operations (no writes or modifications)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- ✅ Structured logging with zap
- ✅ Input validation for all methods
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup (defer rows.Close())

**Test Status**:
- ✅ Backend Selection: 4/4 tests active and passing (table-driven)
- ⏸️  Database-dependent tests: 11 tests skipped (await Day 8 integration testing with PODMAN)

### REFACTOR Phase (2h) ✅

**Completed Enhancements**:
1. ✅ Extracted aggregation logic to separate `AggregationService`
2. ✅ Integrated aggregation service into Router
3. ✅ Implemented sophisticated aggregation methods:
   - `AggregateWithFilters` - Dynamic filter-based aggregation
   - `GetTopFailingActions` - Failure pattern analysis
   - `GetActionComparison` - Comparative analysis across action types
   - `GetNamespaceHealthScore` - Health scoring algorithm (0.0-1.0 scale)
4. ✅ Statistical relevance (minimum sample sizes)
5. ✅ Normalized scoring algorithms

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `pkg/contextapi/query/aggregation.go` (~420 lines) - Dedicated aggregation service
- ✅ Updated `pkg/contextapi/query/router.go` - Integrated aggregation service

**Enhanced Features**:
- Dynamic SQL query building based on filters
- Top failing actions with failure rate analysis
- Multi-action comparison with success rate ranking
- Namespace health scoring with weighted factors:
  - 60% resolution rate
  - 30% critical incident ratio
  - 10% speed factor (resolution time)

### BR Coverage
- **BR-CONTEXT-004**: Query Aggregation ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Alignment

### ✅ Correct Implementation
1. ✅ Queries `remediation_audit` table (created by Data Storage Service)
2. ✅ Read-only operations (no writes)
3. ✅ No LLM configuration (Context API is data provider only)
4. ✅ No embedding generation (queries pre-existing embeddings)
5. ✅ Proper error handling and logging
6. ✅ Input validation

### 📋 Query Patterns

**Success Rate Aggregation** (30-day window):
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN phase = 'completed' AND status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_attempts,
    COALESCE(
        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN phase = 'completed' AND status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) /
        NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0),
        0.0
    ) as success_rate
FROM remediation_audit
WHERE action_type = $1
  AND start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
```

**Namespace Grouping** (7-day window):
```sql
SELECT namespace, COUNT(*) as count
FROM remediation_audit
WHERE start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY namespace
ORDER BY count DESC
```

**Incident Trend** (daily data points):
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', start_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM remediation_audit
WHERE start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * $1
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', start_time)
ORDER BY date ASC
```
