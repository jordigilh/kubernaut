# v1.x Unit Tests (Reference Material)

**Status**: Preserved as reference, not executed
**Extension**: `.v1x` (not compiled by Go)
**Purpose**: Reference material for Days 2-7 implementation

## Files Preserved

| File | Lines | Purpose | v2.0 Day |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `cache_fallback_test.go.v1x` | ~240 | Cache fallback scenarios | Day 3-4 |
| `cache_test.go.v1x` | ~340 | Multi-tier cache tests | Day 3 |
| `models_test.go.v1x` | ~230 | Data model validation | Day 2 |
| `query_builder_test.go.v1x` | ~450 | SQL query construction | Day 2 |
| `query_router_test.go.v1x` | ~280 | Query routing logic | Day 6 |
| `server_test.go.v1x` | ~380 | HTTP server endpoints | Day 7 |
| `vector_search_test.go.v1x` | ~380 | Semantic search tests | Day 5 |

**Total**: ~2,300 lines of v1.x unit tests

## Why Preserved (Not Deleted)?

**Rationale**:
1. **Reference Value**: May provide insights for v2.0 test patterns
2. **Edge Cases**: v1.x may have discovered edge cases worth testing
3. **Git History**: Easier to access than git history
4. **No Harm**: `.v1x` extension means they don't compile or interfere

**Risk**: VERY LOW (they're just reference files)

## v2.0 Implementation Approach

Each day (Days 2-7) will follow **TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**:

1. **DO-RED**: Write failing tests from scratch (not copy v1.x)
2. **DO-GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **DO-REFACTOR**: Enhance with production patterns

**Note**: v1.x tests may be referenced for ideas but won't be copied directly.

## Current Test Status

**Day 1 v2.0 Tests** (Active):
- ✅ `client_test.go` - 8 tests PASSING
- ✅ PostgreSQL client foundation complete
- ✅ Integration test infrastructure ready

**v1.x Tests** (Reference Only):
- ⚠️ All have `.v1x` extension (not compiled)
- ⚠️ Would require updates for v2.0 architecture
- ⚠️ Will be rewritten fresh in Days 2-7

---

## Deletion Policy

**When to Delete**: After Day 7 complete, if v1.x tests provided no value

**Git Safety**: All v1.x code also preserved in git history
- Commit: (see git log for v1.x implementation)
- Branch: feature/data-storage-service

**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025
**v2.0 Progress**: Day 1 Complete (8% of 13 days)
