// BR-GATEWAY-015-016: Storm Detection
// Business Outcome: Prevent creating 100 RemediationRequest CRDs when 100 pods crash
// Instead, create 1 CRD that says "storm affecting 100 pods"
//
// NOTE: Storm detection unit tests focus on the BUSINESS LOGIC of storm detection,
// not the Redis integration. Integration tests verify Redis persistence.
// This follows the principle: Unit tests = business outcome, Integration tests = infrastructure
