# BR-GATEWAY-093: Circuit Breaker for Kubernetes API

**Business Requirement ID**: BR-GATEWAY-093
**Category**: Gateway Service (Signal Ingestion & Processing)
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Target Version**: V1.0
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2026-01-03)
**Date**: 2025-11-05
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15

---

## 📋 **Business Need**

### **Problem Statement**

Gateway Service is the **P0-Critical entry point** for Kubernaut, responsible for ingesting external alerts and creating RemediationRequest CRDs in the Kubernetes API. As a critical dependency, **Kubernetes API failures or degradation can cause cascading failures** that impact the entire system.

**Current Limitations** (Pre-BR-GATEWAY-093):
- ❌ **No fail-fast protection**: Gateway continues attempting K8s API requests during outages, consuming resources
- ❌ **Request queue buildup**: Failed requests accumulate, causing memory pressure and eventual OOM
- ❌ **Cascading failures**: Gateway degradation impacts upstream alert sources (webhook timeouts)
- ❌ **No observability**: Cannot detect when K8s API is degraded (requires manual log analysis)
- ❌ **Retry storm risk**: Exponential backoff alone cannot prevent overwhelming K8s API during recovery

**Impact**:
- **Alert Loss**: Critical alerts dropped during K8s API outages or rate limiting
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Gateway pods OOM-killed due to request queue buildup
- **Control Plane Overload**: Retry storms during recovery can overwhelm K8s API server
- **SRE Blind Spots**: No metrics to detect K8s API degradation before cascading failure
- **Recovery Delays**: Manual intervention required to restore Gateway functionality

---

## 🎯 **Business Objective**

**Gateway Service SHALL implement circuit breaker protection for the Kubernetes API dependency to enable fail-fast behavior, prevent cascading failures during K8s API degradation, and provide observable metrics for SRE response.**

### **Success Criteria**
1. ✅ **Fail-Fast Protection**: Gateway returns immediate 503 errors when K8s API circuit breaker is open (no request queue buildup)
2. ✅ **Cascading Failure Prevention**: K8s API overload or rate limiting does NOT cause Gateway OOM or timeout errors
3. ✅ **Observable State**: Prometheus metrics expose circuit breaker state (closed/half-open/open) and operation results (success/failure)
4. ✅ **Automatic Recovery Testing**: Circuit breaker transitions to half-open state after timeout, allowing limited test requests
5. ✅ **Configurable Thresholds**: Circuit breaker trip conditions (failure rate, request volume) are tunable via configuration

---

## 📊 **Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: K8s API Server Outage**

**Scenario**: Kubernetes API server becomes unavailable due to control plane maintenance or etcd failure.

**Current Flow** (Without Circuit Breaker):
```
1. Gateway receives alert webhook from Prometheus
2. Gateway creates RemediationRequest CRD → K8s API returns 503 (unavailable)
3. Gateway retries with exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s
4. ❌ All retries fail, consuming 15 seconds per request
5. ❌ 100 concurrent requests = 100 goroutines waiting, consuming memory
6. ❌ After 5 minutes: Gateway OOM (>500MB memory), pod killed
7. ❌ Alert loss: All alerts during outage window are dropped
```

**Desired Flow with BR-GATEWAY-093**:
```
1. Gateway receives alert webhook from Prometheus
2. Gateway creates RemediationRequest CRD → K8s API returns 503 (unavailable)
3. ✅ Circuit breaker detects 50% failure rate (5/10 requests failed)
4. ✅ Circuit breaker OPENS → fail-fast mode enabled
5. ✅ Subsequent requests return immediately: "K8s API circuit breaker open"
6. ✅ No goroutine accumulation, memory usage stable (<100MB)
7. ✅ After 30 seconds: Circuit breaker transitions to HALF-OPEN (test recovery)
8. ✅ 3 test requests allowed → K8s API recovers → circuit breaker CLOSES
9. ✅ Normal operation resumed, no manual intervention
```

**Business Value**: Prevents Gateway OOM, enables automatic recovery, preserves alert handling capacity during transient outages.

---

### **Use Case 2: K8s API Rate Limiting (High Load)**

**Scenario**: Kubernetes API server rate limits Gateway due to high alert volume (e.g., 1000 alerts in 1 minute during storm).

**Current Flow** (Without Circuit Breaker):
```
1. Gateway receives 1000 alerts from Prometheus (storm scenario)
2. Gateway attempts to create 1000 RemediationRequest CRDs concurrently
3. K8s API server rate limits: Returns 429 (Too Many Requests) after 500 requests
4. ❌ Gateway retries 500 failed requests with exponential backoff
5. ❌ Retry storm: Gateway continues hammering K8s API during recovery
6. ❌ K8s API server overload worsens, affecting other services (cascading failure)
7. ❌ Gateway latency p99 > 10 seconds (missed SLO: <100ms target)
```

**Desired Flow with BR-GATEWAY-093**:
```
1. Gateway receives 1000 alerts from Prometheus (storm scenario)
2. Gateway attempts to create RemediationRequest CRDs
3. K8s API server rate limits: Returns 429 (Too Many Requests)
4. ✅ Circuit breaker detects 50% failure rate (5/10 requests hit rate limit)
5. ✅ Circuit breaker OPENS → fail-fast mode enabled
6. ✅ Remaining 500 requests return immediately (no retry storm)
7. ✅ K8s API server load reduced, recovers faster (no cascading failure)
8. ✅ After 30 seconds: Circuit breaker tests recovery (3 requests)
9. ✅ K8s API accepts requests → circuit breaker CLOSES
10. ✅ Storm aggregation logic handles subsequent alerts efficiently
```

**Business Value**: Protects K8s control plane from overload, enables faster recovery from rate limiting, prevents cascading failures to other services.

---

### **Use Case 3: SRE Observability During K8s API Degradation**

**Scenario**: SRE team needs to detect and respond to K8s API degradation before it causes Gateway OOM or alert loss.

**Current Flow** (Without Circuit Breaker):
```
1. K8s API server experiences high latency (p95: 500ms → 5s)
2. Gateway CRD creation requests slow down (no immediate failure)
3. ❌ No metrics to detect K8s API degradation
4. ❌ SRE discovers issue only after Gateway OOM alert fires (too late)
5. ❌ Manual investigation required: kubectl logs, API server metrics
6. ❌ Remediation time: 15-30 minutes (manual pod restart, troubleshooting)
```

**Desired Flow with BR-GATEWAY-093**:
```
1. K8s API server experiences high latency (p95: 500ms → 5s)
2. Gateway CRD creation requests slow down, some timeout (>30s)
3. ✅ Circuit breaker detects 50% failure rate (timeouts count as failures)
4. ✅ Circuit breaker OPENS → Prometheus metric updated:
   - gateway_circuit_breaker_state{name="k8s-api"} = 2 (OPEN)
5. ✅ Alertmanager fires: "GatewayK8sAPICircuitBreakerOpen" (critical)
6. ✅ SRE team notified immediately (PagerDuty, Slack)
7. ✅ SRE investigates K8s API server metrics (before Gateway OOM)
8. ✅ Proactive remediation: Scale K8s API replicas, reduce etcd load
9. ✅ Circuit breaker automatically recovers when K8s API stabilizes
```

**Business Value**: Enables proactive SRE response, reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) from 30 minutes to <5 minutes, prevents alert loss through early detection.

## 🔧 **Functional Requirements**

### **FR-BR-GATEWAY-093-01: Circuit Breaker State Machine**

**Requirement**: Gateway **SHALL** implement a circuit breaker with three states: **Closed** (normal), **Open** (fail-fast), and **Half-Open** (recovery testing).

**Implementation Details**:

**Circuit Breaker States**:
```go
// State transitions
type State int

const (
    StateClosed   State = 0 // Normal operation (all requests allowed)
    StateHalfOpen State = 1 // Recovery testing (limited requests allowed)
    StateOpen     State = 2 // Fail-fast (all requests blocked)
)

// State transition conditions
Closed → Open:       50% failure rate over 10 requests
Open → HalfOpen:     30 seconds timeout elapsed
HalfOpen → Closed:   3 consecutive successful test requests
HalfOpen → Open:     Any test request fails
```

**Library**: `github.com/sony/gobreaker` (industry-standard, production-grade)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Circuit breaker starts in **Closed** state (normal operation)
- ✅ Circuit breaker transitions to **Open** when 50% of 10+ requests fail
- ✅ Circuit breaker transitions to **Half-Open** after 30 seconds in Open state
- ✅ Circuit breaker allows exactly 3 test requests in Half-Open state
- ✅ Circuit breaker transitions back to **Closed** if all 3 test requests succeed
- ✅ Circuit breaker transitions back to **Open** if any test request fails

---

### **FR-BR-GATEWAY-093-02: Fail-Fast Behavior (BR-GATEWAY-093-A)**

**Requirement**: Gateway **SHALL** return immediate errors when K8s API circuit breaker is open, without attempting CRD creation or consuming resources.

**Implementation Details**:

**Fail-Fast Logic**:
```go
func (c *ClientWithCircuitBreaker) CreateRemediationRequest(ctx context.Context, rr *RemediationRequest) error {
    _, err := c.circuitBreaker.Execute(func() (interface{}, error) {
        // Circuit breaker is OPEN → return gobreaker.ErrOpenState immediately
        if c.circuitBreaker.State() == gobreaker.StateOpen {
            return nil, gobreaker.ErrOpenState
        }

        // Circuit breaker is CLOSED/HALF-OPEN → execute K8s API call
        return nil, c.k8sClient.Create(ctx, rr)
    })
    return err
}
```

**Error Response**:
```go
// HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
{
    "error": "Kubernetes API circuit breaker open",
    "retry_after": "30s"
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ When circuit breaker is **Open**, CRD creation returns `gobreaker.ErrOpenState` immediately (<1ms latency)
- ✅ No goroutine accumulation during fail-fast mode (goroutine count remains stable)
- ✅ Memory usage does not increase during K8s API outages (no request queue buildup)
- ✅ Gateway returns HTTP 503 with `retry_after` header to indicate transient unavailability

---

### **FR-BR-GATEWAY-093-03: Idempotent Operation Handling**

**Requirement**: Gateway **SHALL** treat `AlreadyExists` errors as idempotent successes to prevent false positives from tripping the circuit breaker during parallel test execution or duplicate alert handling.

**Implementation Details**:

**Idempotent Error Handling**:
```go
func (c *ClientWithCircuitBreaker) CreateRemediationRequest(ctx context.Context, rr *RemediationRequest) error {
    _, err := c.circuitBreaker.Execute(func() (interface{}, error) {
        err := c.k8sClient.Create(ctx, rr)

        // Treat "AlreadyExists" as success for circuit breaker purposes
        if k8serrors.IsAlreadyExists(err) {
            return nil, nil  // Circuit breaker: success (don't increment failure count)
        }

        // All other errors: return as-is
        return nil, err
    })
    return err
}
```

**Rationale**: `AlreadyExists` errors occur during:
- **Parallel test execution**: Multiple test processes attempt to create the same CRD with identical fingerprint
- **Duplicate alert handling**: Prometheus sends duplicate alerts due to HA configuration
- **Retry logic**: Gateway retries CRD creation after transient failure, but CRD already exists

These are **idempotent operations**, not true failures. Treating them as failures would cause false positives and premature circuit breaker tripping.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ `AlreadyExists` errors do NOT increment circuit breaker failure count
- ✅ `AlreadyExists` errors are recorded as **success** in Prometheus metrics
- ✅ Circuit breaker does not trip during parallel test execution (50+ concurrent tests)
- ✅ Circuit breaker does not trip during duplicate alert storms (100+ alerts with same fingerprint)

---

### **FR-BR-GATEWAY-093-04: Observable Metrics (BR-GATEWAY-093-C)**

**Requirement**: Gateway **SHALL** expose Prometheus metrics for circuit breaker state and operation results to enable SRE monitoring and alerting.

**Implementation Details**:

**Metrics Exposed**:
```go
// Circuit breaker state gauge (0=Closed, 1=Half-Open, 2=Open)
gateway_circuit_breaker_state{name="k8s-api"} 0
```

**Metric Update Logic**:
```go
// Update state metric on state transitions
func (cb *CircuitBreaker) OnStateChange(name string, from State, to State) {
    metrics.CircuitBreakerState.WithLabelValues(name).Set(float64(to))
}
```

**Alerting Rules**:
```yaml
# Alert when circuit breaker is open (K8s API degraded)
- alert: GatewayK8sAPICircuitBreakerOpen
  expr: gateway_circuit_breaker_state{name="k8s-api"} == 2
  for: 30s
  severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Gateway K8s API circuit breaker OPEN (fail-fast mode)"
    description: "K8s API is degraded. Gateway rejecting requests to prevent cascading failure."
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Prometheus scrapes `gateway_circuit_breaker_state` metric (0/1/2 values)
- ✅ Alertmanager fires `GatewayK8sAPICircuitBreakerOpen` alert when state = 2 (Open)
- ✅ Grafana dashboard visualizes circuit breaker state and failure rate trends

---

### **FR-BR-GATEWAY-093-05: Configurable Thresholds**

**Requirement**: Gateway **SHALL** support configurable circuit breaker thresholds (failure rate, request volume, timeout, max requests) to enable production tuning without code changes.

**Implementation Details**:

**Configuration Schema**:
```go
type CircuitBreakerConfig struct {
    Enabled        bool          `yaml:"enabled" default:"true"`
    FailureRatio   float64       `yaml:"failureRatio" default:"0.5"`      // 50% failure rate
    RequestVolume  int           `yaml:"requestVolume" default:"10"`      // Min 10 requests before evaluation
    Timeout        time.Duration `yaml:"timeout" default:"30s"`           // Stay open for 30s before half-open
    MaxRequests    uint32        `yaml:"maxRequests" default:"3"`         // Allow 3 test requests in half-open
    Interval       time.Duration `yaml:"interval" default:"10s"`          // Reset failure counters every 10s
}
```

**ConfigMap Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubernaut-gateway-config
  namespace: kubernaut-system
data:
  config.yaml: |
    circuitBreaker:
      enabled: true
      failureRatio: 0.5      # Trip at 50% failure rate
      requestVolume: 10      # Require at least 10 requests
      timeout: 30s           # Stay open for 30 seconds
      maxRequests: 3         # Allow 3 test requests in half-open
      interval: 10s          # Reset counters every 10 seconds
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Circuit breaker thresholds are read from ConfigMap on Gateway startup
- ✅ Circuit breaker can be disabled via `enabled: false` (for debugging)
- ✅ Circuit breaker respects `failureRatio` (e.g., 0.3 = 30% failure rate)
- ✅ Circuit breaker respects `requestVolume` (e.g., 20 = require 20 requests before trip)
- ✅ Circuit breaker respects `timeout` (e.g., 60s = stay open for 60 seconds)
- ✅ Circuit breaker respects `maxRequests` (e.g., 5 = allow 5 test requests in half-open)

---

## 📈 **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **NFR-BR-GATEWAY-093-01: Performance**

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ No race conditions detected during parallel test execution (50+ goroutines)
- ✅ Circuit breaker state transitions are atomic (no partial state updates)

---

### **NFR-BR-GATEWAY-093-03: Observability**

**Requirement**: Circuit breaker state transitions **SHALL** be logged at INFO level for audit and troubleshooting.

**Log Format**:
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": "2026-01-15T10:23:45Z",
  "logger": "gateway.circuit-breaker",
  "msg": "Circuit breaker state transition",
  "name": "k8s-api",
  "from_state": "closed",
  "to_state": "open",
  "reason": "failure_rate_exceeded",
  "failure_count": 6,
  "total_requests": 10,
  "failure_ratio": 0.6
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Every state transition (Closed→Open, Open→Half-Open, Half-Open→Closed) is logged
- ✅ Logs include failure counts, total requests, and failure ratio for debugging

    gwServer := gateway.NewServerWithK8sClient(config, logger, metrics, failingClient)

    // Make 10 requests (should trip circuit breaker at 50% failure rate)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        _, err := gwServer.ProcessSignal(ctx, signal)
        // Expect some failures
    }

    // Verify circuit breaker is OPEN
    Expect(failingClient.circuitBreaker.State()).To(Equal(gobreaker.StateOpen))

    // Verify fail-fast behavior (immediate error, no retry)
    _, err := gwServer.ProcessSignal(ctx, signal)
