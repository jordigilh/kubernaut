## 7. Conclusion

This modular work plan provides a structured approach to implementing the Kubernaut microservices architecture while addressing critical issues identified in the unit test triage. The plan prioritizes fixing existing critical issues before implementing new services, ensuring a stable foundation for the microservices migration.

**Next Steps (Rule-Compliant):**
1. Begin Sprint 1 with critical workflow engine fixes (CHECKPOINT D validation)
2. Establish test infrastructure improvements (Rule 03 pyramid approach)
3. Proceed with AI service optimization (Rule 12 AI/ML methodology)
4. Implement processor service separation (Rule 01 integration validation)
5. Complete remaining services based on business priority (Rule 00 TDD sequence)

**Success depends on:**
- Fixing critical issues first (workflow engine, test infrastructure)
- Maintaining TDD methodology throughout implementation (Rule 00 compliance)
- Ensuring proper service isolation and communication patterns (Rule 02 Go standards)
- Comprehensive testing at each phase (Rule 03 pyramid strategy)
- Always-Applied Rules CHECKPOINT validation at each step
- Rule 12 AI/ML methodology for AI components
