❌ **Production Deployments**: Internal testing only (no customer production yet)
❌ **Case Studies**: No customer testimonials (projected only)
⚠️ **Community Size**: Small (building pre-launch)

**Why This Is OK**:
- **Technology is validated**: HolmesGPT benchmarks prove AI works
- **Market is validated**: Datadog, Akuity prove demand exists
- **Architecture is complete**: 12 microservices production-ready Q4 2025
- **Partnership path clear**: Red Hat integration timeline defined (Q2 2026 GA)
