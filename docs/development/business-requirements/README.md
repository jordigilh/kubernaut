# Business Requirement Tests

This directory contains tests that validate **business outcomes and requirements**, not implementation details.

## 🎯 **Purpose**

Business requirement tests focus on **"Does it solve the business problem?"** rather than **"Does the code work correctly?"**

## 📁 **Directory Structure**

```
test/business-requirements/
├── ai/                     # AI and machine learning business requirements
├── workflow/               # Workflow execution business requirements
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure and platform business requirements
├── integration/           # Cross-component business requirements
└── shared/                # Shared business test utilities
```

## 🧪 **Test Characteristics**

### **Business Requirement Tests** (`test/business-requirements/`)
- ✅ **Focus**: Business outcomes and value delivery
- ✅ **Validate**: User requirements, performance criteria, business logic
- ✅ **Use**: Real or realistic data, controlled mocks for external systems
- ✅ **Measure**: Business metrics (accuracy, time savings, cost reduction)

**Example:**
```go
Describe("BR-001: System Must Reduce Alert Noise by 80%", func() {
    It("should significantly reduce duplicate alerts through intelligent correlation", func() {
        // Given: Historical pattern of 100 similar alerts per hour
        // When: Alert correlation is enabled
        // Then: Alert volume should reduce to <20 alerts per hour
        // And: Business stakeholders can measure the improvement
    })
})
```

### **Unit Tests** (`pkg/*/`)
- ✅ **Focus**: Implementation correctness and code mechanics
- ✅ **Validate**: Function behavior, error handling, edge cases
- ✅ **Use**: Minimal mocks, focus on isolated component behavior
- ✅ **Measure**: Code coverage, execution time, memory usage

**Example:**
```go
Describe("ValidationEngine.ValidateWorkflow", func() {
    It("should return error for circular dependencies", func() {
        // Given: Workflow with step A depends on B, B depends on A
        // When: Validating workflow
        // Then: Should return CircularDependencyError
    })
})
```

## 🏷️ **Naming Conventions**

### Business Requirement Tests
- **File naming**: `*_business_test.go`
- **Test naming**: `BR-{COMPONENT}-{NUMBER}: {Business Description}`
- **Context naming**: Business outcome focused

### Unit Tests
- **File naming**: `*_test.go` (existing convention)
- **Test naming**: `{Component}.{Method}` or implementation-focused
- **Context naming**: Technical behavior focused

## 📊 **Business Requirement ID Format**

| Component | ID Pattern | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **AI Systems** | `BR-AI-###` | `BR-AI-001: AI Must Learn From Failures` |
| **Workflows** | `BR-WF-###` | `BR-WF-001: Workflows Must Execute Real K8s Operations` |
| **Infrastructure** | `BR-INF-###` | `BR-INF-001: System Must Handle 10K Alerts/Hour` |
| **Integration** | `BR-INT-###` | `BR-INT-001: End-to-End Processing Under 30 Seconds` |

## 🎯 **When to Use Each Test Type**

### Use **Business Requirement Tests** when:
- ❓ Testing user-facing features and outcomes
- ❓ Validating performance and reliability requirements
- ❓ Measuring business value delivery
- ❓ Testing cross-component workflows
- ❓ Stakeholders need to understand test results

### Use **Unit Tests** when:
- ❓ Testing internal component logic
- ❓ Validating error handling and edge cases
- ❓ Testing individual functions/methods
- ❓ Ensuring code correctness and robustness
- ❓ Developers need fast feedback on code changes

## 🚀 **Migration Guidelines**

### Moving Existing Tests
1. **Identify business-focused tests** in `pkg/*/` directories
2. **Move to appropriate business-requirements subdirectory**
3. **Update package name** to reflect new location
4. **Ensure test focuses on business outcomes**
5. **Update imports** to use centralized mocks from `pkg/testutil/mocks/`

### Test Quality Criteria
- **Business tests** should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- **Unit tests** should focus on implementation correctness
- **Both types** should use centralized mocks from `pkg/testutil/mocks/`
- **Integration** should prefer real dependencies where feasible
