# Context API Health Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The **Context API was showing as "unhealthy"** in the integration services, preventing proper integration testing.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **mismatch between the Docker health check endpoint and the actual API endpoint**:

- **Docker Health Check Expected**: `http://localhost:8091/health`
- **Actual API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8091/api/v1/context/health`

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Updated Docker Compose Health Check

**File**: `test/integration/docker-compose.integration.yml`

**Before** (broken):
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8091/health || exit 1"]
```

**After** (fixed):
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8091/api/v1/context/health || exit 1"]
```

## ✅ Validation Results

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8091/api/v1/context/health
# ✅ SUCCESS: {"cache_hit_rate":0,"context_types":5,"service":"context-api","status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-09-26T21:00:17.31455413Z","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### Integration Services Status
```bash
make integration-services-status
# ✅ SUCCESS: All services now show as (healthy)
```

**Final Status**:
- ✅ `kubernaut-integration-postgres` - (healthy)
- ✅ `kubernaut-integration-vectordb` - (healthy)
- ✅ `kubernaut-integration-redis` - (healthy)
- ✅ `kubernaut-context-api` - **(healthy)** 🎉
- ✅ `kubernaut-holmesgpt-api` - (healthy)

## 🚀 Integration Environment Ready

The integration environment is now fully operational:

### Available Services
- **PostgreSQL Database**: `localhost:5433` (action_history)
- **Vector Database**: `localhost:5434` (vector_store)
- **Redis Cache**: `localhost:6380`
- **Context API**: `localhost:8091` (with working health checks)
- **HolmesGPT API**: `localhost:3000` (port mapped from 8090)

### Available Endpoints
- **Context API Health**: `http://localhost:8091/api/v1/context/health`
- **Toolsets API**: `http://localhost:8091/api/v1/toolsets`
- **Service Discovery**: `http://localhost:8091/api/v1/service-discovery`

## 🧪 Ready for Integration Testing

The environment is now ready for:

```bash
# Run integration tests
make test-integration-dev

# Check environment status
make dev-status

# Run specific integration test suites
go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/shared -v
go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/ai -v
```

## 🔗 Related Fixes

This fix complements the earlier **integration test build fixes**:
1. ✅ **Type Mismatches**: Fixed `DiscoveredPattern` type conflicts
2. ✅ **Build Errors**: All integration tests now compile successfully
3. ✅ **Service Health**: All integration services now report healthy status

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Health Check Alignment**: Always ensure Docker health checks match actual API endpoints
2. **API Documentation**: The Context API provides comprehensive health endpoints under `/api/v1/context/health`
3. **Service Dependencies**: The Context API was actually working fine - only the health check was misconfigured

---

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Context API is now healthy and integration environment is fully operational.
