**Business Requirement ID**: BR-RR-001
**Category**: RemediationRequest Enhancement
**Priority**: Medium
**Target Version**: V2
**Status**: ‚úÖ Approved for V2
**Date**: October 20, 2025

---

## üìã **Business Need**

### **Problem Statement**

When an operator **rejects** an AI-generated remediation recommendation (medium confidence, 60-79%), they currently have **no way** to execute an alternative recommendation while maintaining Kubernaut's audit trail and effectiveness tracking.

**Current Limitations**:
1. ‚ùå Cannot force a specific remediation action
2. ‚ùå Cannot bypass AI analysis when operator knows the correct action
3. ‚ùå Must use manual `kubectl` commands (bypassing Kubernaut tracking)
4. ‚ùå No audit trail for operator-initiated remediations

**Impact**:
- Lost effectiveness tracking data (manual actions not recorded)
- Incomplete audit trail (compliance risk)
- Operator frustration (cannot execute alternatives within system)
- Learning system gap (no feedback on operator-chosen alternatives)

---

## üéØ **Business Objective**

**Enable operators to force specific remediation actions while maintaining Kubernaut's audit trail, effectiveness tracking, and learning capabilities.**

### **Success Criteria**

1. ‚úÖ Operators can create `RemediationRequest` with forced recommendation
2. ‚úÖ AI analysis can be bypassed when operator specifies action
3. ‚úÖ Forced remediations are tracked in effectiveness monitoring
4. ‚úÖ Audit trail captures operator-initiated actions
5. ‚úÖ System learns from operator-chosen alternatives

---

## üìä **Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Alternative Recommendation After Rejection**

**Scenario**: AI recommends "scale to 5 replicas" (confidence: 65%), operator rejects due to resource constraints, wants to try "scale to 3 replicas" instead.

**Current Flow**:
```
1. AI recommends: scale to 5 replicas (65% confidence)
2. Operator rejects (resource constraints)
3. RemediationRequest fails
4. Operator executes manually: kubectl scale deployment webapp --replicas=3
5. ‚ùå No audit trail, no effectiveness tracking, no learning
```

**Desired Flow with BR-RR-001**:
```
1. AI recommends: scale to 5 replicas (65% confidence)
2. Operator rejects
3. Operator creates new RemediationRequest with forced recommendation:
   forcedRecommendation:
     action: "scale-deployment"
     parameters:
       deployment: "webapp"
       targetReplicas: 3
4. ‚úÖ Kubernaut executes, tracks, and learns from operator's choice
```

---

### **Use Case 2: Expert Operator Override**

**Scenario**: Production incident, experienced operator knows exact fix, wants to bypass AI analysis time (saves 1-2 minutes).

**Current Flow**:
```
1. Alert fires
2. Wait for AI analysis (1-2 minutes)
3. AI recommendation may not match operator's known fix
4. Operator executes manually: kubectl rollout restart deployment/webapp
5. ‚ùå Wasted AI analysis time, no tracking
```

**Desired Flow with BR-RR-001**:
```
1. Alert fires
2. Operator creates RemediationRequest with forced recommendation:
   forcedRecommendation:
     action: "restart-deployment"
     parameters:
       deployment: "webapp"
   bypassAIAnalysis: true
3. ‚úÖ Immediate execution, full audit trail, effectiveness tracking
```

---

### **Use Case 3: Incident Postmortem Learning**

**Scenario**: After incident resolution, team wants to test different remediation approaches to improve AI training.

**Current Flow**:
```
1. Incident resolved manually
2. Team wants to test "what would have worked better"
3. Cannot replay with different actions in Kubernaut
4. ‚ùå No systematic learning from postmortem analysis
```

**Desired Flow with BR-RR-001**:
```
1. Incident resolved
2. Team creates test RemediationRequests with forced recommendations
3. Compare effectiveness of different approaches
4. ‚úÖ System learns optimal actions for similar future incidents
```

---

## üîß **Functional Requirements**

### **FR-RR-001-01: Forced Recommendation Field**

**Requirement**: `RemediationRequest` CRD SHALL support an optional `forcedRecommendation` field.

**CRD Schema**:
```yaml
apiVersion: remediation.kubernaut.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemediationRequest
spec:
  # ... existing fields ...

  # NEW: Forced recommendation (optional)
  forcedRecommendation:
    # Action type (from 29 canonical actions)
    action: string  # e.g., "scale-deployment", "restart-pod", "rollback-deployment"

    # Action-specific parameters
    parameters: map[string]interface{}  # e.g., {"deployment": "webapp", "targetReplicas": 3}

    # Operator justification (for audit trail)
    justification: string  # e.g., "Resource constraints - scaling to 3 instead of AI's 5"

    # Operator who forced the recommendation
    forcedBy: string  # e.g., "user@company.com"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ CRD validates `action` is one of 29 canonical action types
- ‚úÖ CRD validates required parameters for each action type
- ‚úÖ Justification is required (min 10 chars, max 500 chars)
- ‚úÖ `forcedBy` defaults to authenticated user (from kubectl context)

---

### **FR-RR-001-02: Bypass AI Analysis Flag**

**Requirement**: `RemediationRequest` CRD SHALL support an optional `bypassAIAnalysis` boolean flag.

**CRD Schema**:
```yaml
apiVersion: remediation.kubernaut.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemediationRequest
spec:
  # ... existing fields ...

  # NEW: Skip AI analysis (optional, default: false)
  bypassAIAnalysis: boolean  # true = skip AIAnalysis, go directly to WorkflowExecution
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Default value: `false` (normal AI analysis flow)
- ‚úÖ When `true` AND `forcedRecommendation` is set: skip AIAnalysis CRD creation
- ‚úÖ When `true` BUT `forcedRecommendation` is NOT set: ERROR (invalid configuration)
- ‚úÖ RemediationOrchestrator creates WorkflowExecution directly from forced recommendation

---

### **FR-RR-001-03: RemediationOrchestrator Logic**

**Requirement**: RemediationOrchestrator controller SHALL handle forced recommendations.

**Logic**:
```go
func (r *RemediationRequestReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
    var rr remediationv1alpha1.RemediationRequest
    r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, &rr)

    // Check for forced recommendation
    if rr.Spec.ForcedRecommendation != nil {
        if rr.Spec.BypassAIAnalysis {
            // Skip AIAnalysis, create WorkflowExecution directly
            workflow := r.createWorkflowFromForcedRecommendation(ctx, &rr)
            return r.createWorkflowExecution(ctx, &rr, workflow)
        } else {
            // Create AIAnalysis with forced recommendation hint
            // AI can validate/enhance but cannot override
            return r.createAIAnalysisWithHint(ctx, &rr)
        }
    }

    // Normal flow (no forced recommendation)
    return r.handleNormalFlow(ctx, &rr)
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Forced recommendation bypasses AIAnalysis when `bypassAIAnalysis: true`
- ‚úÖ Forced recommendation creates WorkflowExecution directly
- ‚úÖ Audit logs capture operator identity and justification
- ‚úÖ Metrics track forced vs AI-generated remediations

---

### **FR-RR-001-04: Audit Trail Enhancement**

**Requirement**: Data Storage Service SHALL track forced remediations with operator metadata.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN forced_by VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN forced_justification TEXT;
ALTER TABLE action_history ADD COLUMN bypassed_ai_analysis BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

CREATE INDEX idx_action_history_forced_by ON action_history(forced_by) WHERE forced_by IS NOT NULL;
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Action history records capture `forced_by` field
- ‚úÖ Forced justification stored in audit trail
- ‚úÖ Queries can filter for operator-initiated remediations
- ‚úÖ Effectiveness tracking distinguishes AI vs operator-initiated

---

### **FR-RR-001-05: Safety Validation**

**Requirement**: Forced recommendations SHALL be validated by Rego policies before execution.

**Validation Flow**:
```go
// WorkflowExecution Controller validates forced recommendation
func (r *WorkflowExecutionReconciler) validateForcedRecommendation(ctx context.Context, rr *remediationv1alpha1.RemediationRequest) error {
    regoResult, err := r.regoEvaluator.Evaluate(ctx, "kubernaut.remediation.validate_forced_action", map[string]interface{}{
        "environment":   rr.Spec.Environment,
        "priority":      rr.Spec.Priority,
        "action":        rr.Spec.ForcedRecommendation.Action,
        "parameters":    rr.Spec.ForcedRecommendation.Parameters,
        "forced_by":     rr.Spec.ForcedRecommendation.ForcedBy,
    })

    if regoResult.Decision == "deny" {
        return fmt.Errorf("forced recommendation denied by policy: %s", regoResult.Reason)
    }

    return nil
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Rego policies can deny forced recommendations (e.g., production restrictions)
- ‚úÖ Denied forced recommendations escalate to manual review
- ‚úÖ Policy violations are logged with operator identity
- ‚úÖ Audit trail captures policy denial reasons

---

## üîÑ **Alternatives Considered**

### **Alternative 1: No Forced Recommendation (V1 Current State)**

**Approach**: Operators use manual `kubectl` commands

**Rejected Because**:
- ‚ùå No audit trail
- ‚ùå No effectiveness tracking
- ‚ùå No learning for AI improvement

---

### **Alternative 2: AI Always Required (No Bypass)**

**Approach**: Force recommendation but still require AI analysis

**Rejected Because**:
- ‚ùå Wastes 1-2 minutes for experienced operators
- ‚ùå AI analysis may contradict operator's known-good fix
- ‚ùå Not useful in time-critical production incidents

---

### **Alternative 3: Separate "Manual Remediation" CRD**

**Approach**: Create new CRD type for manual remediations

**Rejected Because**:
- ‚ùå Duplicates RemediationRequest fields
- ‚ùå Increases controller complexity
- ‚ùå Fragments audit trail across CRD types

---

## ‚úÖ **Approval**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR V2**
**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Decision**: Defer to V2 (after V1 validation)
