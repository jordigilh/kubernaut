# AI Context Orchestration - Executive Summary

**Business Requirements Document**: [10_AI_CONTEXT_ORCHESTRATION.md](./10_AI_CONTEXT_ORCHESTRATION.md)
**Feature Category**: AI & Machine Learning Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Business Impact**: Strategic Platform Evolution

---

## üéØ **Executive Overview**

The AI Context Orchestration capability represents a strategic evolution from static context injection to intelligent, AI-driven context gathering for investigation workflows. This enhancement enables HolmesGPT and other AI services to dynamically orchestrate context retrieval, resulting in more efficient, accurate, and scalable investigation processes.

### **Current State Challenge**
- **Static Context Injection**: All context data pre-gathered and sent in large payloads
- **Over-Enrichment**: Unnecessary context increases processing overhead
- **Fixed Approach**: Same context provided regardless of investigation complexity
- **Resource Inefficiency**: High memory usage and network transfer overhead

### **Proposed Solution**
- **Dynamic Context Orchestration**: AI determines what context is needed when
- **On-Demand Retrieval**: Context fetched precisely when and where needed
- **Intelligent Caching**: Smart context caching based on usage patterns
- **Adaptive Investigation**: Context gathering adapts to investigation complexity
