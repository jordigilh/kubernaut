## DD-002: Per-Step Validation Framework (Alternative 2)

### Status
**✅ Approved Design** (2025-10-14)
**Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-14
**Confidence**: 78% (high value with manageable implementation risk)

### Context & Problem
The current remediation system performs validation only at the **workflow level** (before execution starts, after completion). This creates a critical gap: individual workflow steps execute without verifying preconditions or validating outcomes, leading to cascade failures and reduced remediation effectiveness.

**Current State**:
- WorkflowExecution validates safety requirements before workflow execution (BR-WF-015, BR-WF-016)
- WorkflowExecution monitors effectiveness after workflow completion (BR-WF-050, BR-WF-051)
- **Gap**: No per-step precondition checks or postcondition verification

**Problem Scenarios**:
1. **Cascade Failures**: Step 3 expects "deployment has 3 replicas" (from Step 2) but Step 2 failed silently, current state is 1 replica
2. **Unverified Outcomes**: `kubectl scale deployment --replicas=5` succeeds, but only 2 pods start (insufficient resources)
3. **State Assumptions**: Steps make assumptions about cluster state that may be invalid

**Key Requirements**:
- Prevent cascade failures by validating state before each step
- Verify intended outcomes after each step completes
- Maintain high remediation effectiveness (target 85-90%, currently 70%)
- Reduce manual intervention requirements (target 20%, currently 40%)
- Keep false positive rate acceptable (<15%)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Status Quo (Workflow-Level Validation Only)
**Approach**: Continue with current workflow-level validation, no per-step checks

**Pros**:
- ✅ No implementation effort required
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ No risk of false positives

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Cascade failures persist**: 30% of workflows fail due to invalid state assumptions
- ❌ **Unverified outcomes**: 15-20% of "successful" workflows don't achieve intended effect
- ❌ **High manual intervention**: 40% of remediations require human analysis
- ❌ **Poor observability**: Difficult to diagnose why workflows failed
- ❌ **No improvement path**: Effectiveness remains at 70%

**Confidence**: 20% (rejected - unacceptable failure rate)

---

#### Alternative 2: Step-Level Precondition/Postcondition Framework
**Approach**: Add optional preconditions/postconditions to each workflow step, validated via Rego policies before/after step execution

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Prevents cascade failures**: Halt workflow before executing on invalid state (20% reduction)
- ✅ **Verifies outcomes**: Confirm intended effect achieved after each step
- ✅ **Improves effectiveness**: 70% → 85-90% remediation success rate
- ✅ **Better observability**: Clear failure point with state evidence
- ✅ **Reduces MTTR**: 15min → 8min for failed remediation diagnosis
- ✅ **Leverages existing infrastructure**: Reuses Rego policy engine (BR-REGO-001 to BR-REGO-010)
- ✅ **Flexible**: Optional conditions (required=false for warnings, required=true for blocking)
- ✅ **Phased rollout**: Start with high-value actions, expand incrementally

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ **Implementation effort**: 33 days (5-6 weeks) for framework + examples
- ⚠️ **Performance impact**: 2-5 seconds per step for validation
  - **Mitigation**: Make most conditions optional, async verification with timeout
- ⚠️ **False positives risk**: 5-15% (acceptable with gradual condition tightening)
  - **Mitigation**: Start with lenient conditions, tighten based on telemetry
- ⚠️ **Maintenance burden**: 100+ condition policies to maintain (27 actions × 2-5 conditions)
  - **Mitigation**: Reusable condition libraries, automated testing

**Confidence**: 78% (approved - strong ROI with manageable risk)

---

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach (Selective Step Validation)
**Approach**: Add preconditions/postconditions only to high-risk steps (e.g., critical=true steps), skip for low-risk steps

**Pros**:
- ✅ Lower implementation effort (only subset of actions)
- ✅ Reduced performance impact (fewer validation checks)
- ✅ Focus on highest-value scenarios

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Inconsistent behavior**: Some steps validated, others not (confusing UX)
- ❌ **Partial solution**: Cascade failures still occur in non-critical steps
- ❌ **Complex logic**: Need to determine which steps are "high-risk" (subjective)
- ❌ **Limited effectiveness gain**: Only 10-12% improvement (vs 15-20% for full framework)
- ❌ **Harder to expand**: Need to retroactively add conditions to more steps

**Confidence**: 65% (rejected - complexity doesn't justify partial benefit)

### Decision

**APPROVED: Alternative 2** - Step-Level Precondition/Postcondition Framework

**Rationale**:
1. **Strong Business Case**: 15-20% improvement in remediation effectiveness justifies 5-6 weeks development
2. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: Rego policy engine (BR-REGO-001 to BR-REGO-010) already integrated in KubernetesExecutor
3. **Manageable Risk**: Phased implementation (Phase 1: top 5 actions → Phase 2: next 10 → Phase 3: all 27) reduces false positive risk
4. **Favorable ROI**: 3-month payback period (10 hours/month saved × $100/hr = $1000/month benefit, $10K investment)
5. **Architectural Fit**: Natural extension of APDC methodology (preconditions = DO validation, postconditions = CHECK verification)

**Key Insight**: The framework provides **defense-in-depth validation** - catching failures at the step level before they cascade to later steps. The 2-5 second per-step validation overhead is acceptable for 15-20% effectiveness improvement.

**Data Flow**:
1. **WorkflowExecution Controller** evaluates `step.preConditions[]` before creating KubernetesExecution CRD
   - Rego policy evaluation using current cluster state
   - Block execution if required=true condition fails
   - Record results in `status.stepStatuses[].preConditionResults`
2. **KubernetesExecutor Controller** evaluates `spec.preConditions[]` during validating phase
   - Additional action-specific validation before Job creation
   - Integrated with existing dry-run validation (BR-EXEC-059)
3. **KubernetesExecutor** executes action via Kubernetes Job
4. **KubernetesExecutor Controller** evaluates `spec.postConditions[]` after Job completion
   - Query cluster state to verify intended outcome
   - Wait up to `condition.timeout` for async verification (e.g., pods starting)
   - Mark execution failed if required=true postcondition fails
5. **WorkflowExecution Controller** evaluates `step.postConditions[]` during monitoring phase
   - Workflow-level verification after all steps complete
   - Update `status.stepStatuses[].postConditionResults`

**CRD Schema Extensions**:
```go
// WorkflowStep
type WorkflowStep struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    PreConditions  []StepCondition `json:"preConditions,omitempty"`
    PostConditions []StepCondition `json:"postConditions,omitempty"`
}

// StepCondition (also ActionCondition for KubernetesExecution)
type StepCondition struct {
    Type        string `json:"type"`        // "resource_state", "metric_threshold", "pod_count"
    Description string `json:"description"` // Human-readable explanation
    Rego        string `json:"rego"`        // Rego policy expression
    Required    bool   `json:"required"`    // true = blocking, false = warning
    Timeout     string `json:"timeout"`     // "30s" for async checks
}

// ConditionResult
type ConditionResult struct {
    ConditionType   string       `json:"conditionType"`
    Evaluated       bool         `json:"evaluated"`
    Passed          bool         `json:"passed"`
    ErrorMessage    string       `json:"errorMessage,omitempty"`
    EvaluationTime  metav1.Time  `json:"evaluationTime"`
}
```

**Representative Example: scale_deployment**:
```yaml
# Preconditions
preConditions:
  - type: deployment_exists
    description: "Deployment must exist before scaling"
    rego: |
      package precondition
      allow if { input.deployment_found == true }
    required: true

  - type: current_replicas_match
    description: "Current replicas must match expected baseline"
    rego: |
      package precondition
      allow if { input.current_replicas == input.expected_baseline }
    required: false  # warning only

# Postconditions
postConditions:
  - type: desired_replicas_running
    description: "Desired replica count must be running"
    rego: |
      package postcondition
      allow if {
        input.running_pods >= input.target_replicas
        input.deployment_available == true
      }
    required: true
    timeout: "2m"  # wait for pods to start
```

**Phased Implementation**:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Framework + top 5 actions (scale_deployment, restart_pod, increase_resources, rollback_deployment, expand_pvc)
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Next 10 actions (infrastructure, storage, application lifecycle)
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Remaining 12 actions (security, network, database, monitoring)

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ **Remediation Effectiveness**: 70% → 85-90% (+15-20%)
- ✅ **Cascade Failure Prevention**: 30% → 10% (-20%)
- ✅ **Reduced MTTR**: 15 min → 8 min (-47%)
- ✅ **Less Manual Intervention**: 40% → 20% (-20%)
- ✅ **Better Observability**: Step-level failure diagnosis with state evidence
- ✅ **Reuses Infrastructure**: Rego policy engine, dry-run validation patterns
- ✅ **Flexible**: Optional conditions allow gradual tightening

**Negative**:
- ⚠️ **Performance Impact**: +2-5 seconds per step for validation
  - **Mitigation**: Most conditions optional, async verification, cached state queries
- ⚠️ **False Positives**: Estimated 5-15% (acceptable threshold <15%)
  - **Mitigation**: Start with lenient conditions, tighten based on telemetry, required=false for new conditions
- ⚠️ **Maintenance Burden**: 100+ condition policies across 27 actions
  - **Mitigation**: Reusable condition libraries, automated testing, policy versioning
- ⚠️ **Implementation Effort**: 33 days (5-6 weeks) development
  - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, 3-month ROI justifies investment

**Neutral**:
- 🔄 Need to document condition templates for all 27 actions (iterative process)
- 🔄 Condition tuning required based on production telemetry (2-3 months)
- 🔄 Policy governance process needed (review/approval for new conditions)

### Validation Results

**Confidence Assessment Progression**:
- Initial framework proposal: 70% confidence
- After alternatives analysis: 75% confidence
- After risk mitigation planning: 78% confidence

**Key Validation Points**:
