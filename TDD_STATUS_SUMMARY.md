### **Current Status**
- ✅ **17 Passed** (+5 from baseline)
- ❌ **38 Failed** (-5 from baseline)
- ⏸️ **14 Pending**
- ⏭️ **1 Skipped**
- **Progress**: 30.9% → 31.5% pass rate

## ✅ **Completed TDD Fixes**

### **Fix #1: Health Endpoint (Commit: 48291c84)**
**Test**: "should return 200 OK when all dependencies are healthy"  
**Business Requirement**: HEALTH_CHECK_STANDARD.md  
**TDD Analysis**:
- Test Expected: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`
- Implementation Returned: `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Root Cause**: Implementation didn't follow standard

**TDD Fix**:
- Updated `pkg/gateway/server.go` healthHandler
- Changed response from `"ok"` to `"healthy"` + timestamp
- **Result**: ✅ Test passes

**TDD Principle**: Test was correct (defined standard), implementation was wrong

---

### **Fix #2: Redis Key Format (Commit: 3ff4ecfd)**
**Test**: "treats expired fingerprint as new alert after 5-minute TTL"  
**Business Requirement**: BR-GATEWAY-003  
**TDD Analysis**:
- Test Expected: Key format `gateway:dedup:fingerprint:<fingerprint>`
- Implementation Used: Key format `alert:fingerprint:<fingerprint>`
- **Root Cause**: Implementation used wrong key naming convention

**TDD Fix**:
- Updated `pkg/gateway/processing/deduplication.go`
- Changed all occurrences of `alert:fingerprint:` to `gateway:dedup:fingerprint:`
- Affected methods: `Check()`, `Store()`, `Record()`
- **Result**: ✅ Test passes + 3 additional tests pass (bonus fix)

**TDD Principle**: Test was correct (defined key format), implementation was wrong

**Bonus Impact**: This fix also resolved 3 other deduplication tests:
- "uses configurable 5-minute TTL for deduplication window"
- "refreshes TTL on each duplicate detection"
- "preserves duplicate count until TTL expiration"

---

## 🎯 **TDD Methodology Applied**

### **Core Principle**
> **Tests define business requirements → Implementation must match**

### **TDD Process**
1. **Run Focused Test**: Use `-ginkgo.focus` to isolate one test
2. **Read Test Code**: Understand what the test expects (assertions)
3. **Trace Implementation**: Find where implementation diverges
4. **Fix Implementation**: Update code to match test requirements
5. **Verify Fix**: Run test to confirm it passes
6. **Commit Progress**: Document TDD fix with clear rationale

### **NOT TDD**
- ❌ "Fix tests to match implementation"
- ❌ "Tests are wrong, let's change them"
- ❌ "Disable failing tests"

### **YES TDD**
- ✅ "Tests define requirements, fix implementation"
- ✅ "Implementation is wrong if tests fail"
- ✅ "Tests are the specification"

---

## 📋 **Remaining Work**

### **Category Breakdown (38 failures)**

#### **1. Deduplication TTL (0 remaining)** ✅
- ✅ treats expired fingerprint as new alert after 5-minute TTL
- ✅ uses configurable 5-minute TTL for deduplication window
- ✅ refreshes TTL on each duplicate detection
- ✅ preserves duplicate count until TTL expiration

#### **2. K8s API Integration (7 failures)**
- ❌ should create RemediationRequest CRD successfully
- ❌ should populate CRD with correct metadata
- ❌ should handle CRD name collisions
- ❌ should validate CRD schema before creation
- ❌ should handle K8s API temporary failures with retry
- ❌ should handle K8s API quota exceeded gracefully
- ❌ should handle watch connection interruption

#### **3. Redis Integration (6 failures)**
- ❌ should persist deduplication state in Redis
- ❌ should expire deduplication entries after TTL
- ❌ should store storm detection state in Redis
- ❌ should handle concurrent Redis writes without corruption
- ❌ should handle Redis cluster failover without data loss
- ❌ should handle Redis memory eviction (LRU) gracefully

#### **4. Prometheus Alert Processing (25 failures)**
- ❌ creates RemediationRequest CRD with correct business metadata
- ❌ extracts resource information for AI targeting
- ❌ prevents duplicate CRDs using fingerprint
- ❌ (22 more tests...)

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Continue with Category 2: K8s API Integration (7 tests)
2. Use same TDD methodology: focus one test, analyze, fix implementation
3. Commit after each successful fix
4. Track progress in this document

### **Strategy**
- **Focus**: One test at a time using `-ginkgo.focus`
- **Analyze**: Read test to understand business requirement
- **Fix**: Update implementation to match test expectation
- **Verify**: Run full suite to check for regressions
- **Commit**: Document TDD fix with clear rationale

---

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Per-Fix Metrics**
- **Fix #1**: +1 test (health endpoint)
- **Fix #2**: +4 tests (Redis key format + bonus fixes)
- **Average**: +2.5 tests per fix

### **Projected Completion**
- **Remaining**: 38 failures
- **Average Fix Rate**: 2.5 tests per fix
- **Estimated Fixes Needed**: ~15 fixes
- **Time per Fix**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Estimated Time**: ~2-3 hours

### **Quality Indicators**
- ✅ No test modifications (only implementation fixes)
- ✅ No regressions (passing tests remain passing)
- ✅ Clear TDD rationale for each fix
- ✅ Business requirements validated through tests

## 🎓 **TDD Lessons Learned**

### **Lesson #1: Tests Are the Specification**
- Health endpoint test defined standard response format
- Implementation must match, not the other way around

### **Lesson #2: One Fix Can Resolve Multiple Tests**
- Redis key format fix resolved 4 tests at once
- Root cause analysis reveals systemic issues

### **Lesson #3: Infrastructure vs TDD Issues**
- Redis OOM was infrastructure, not TDD
- Must ensure test environment is correct before TDD analysis
