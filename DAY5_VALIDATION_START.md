# Day 5 Validation: CRD Creation + HTTP Server + Pipeline Integration

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: 🚀 Starting Validation

---

## 📋 **DAY 5 SCOPE**

### **Objective**
Implement RemediationRequest CRD creation, HTTP server with chi router, middleware setup, **complete processing pipeline integration**

### **Business Requirements**
- BR-GATEWAY-015: CRD creation
- BR-GATEWAY-017: HTTP server
- BR-GATEWAY-018: Webhook handlers
- BR-GATEWAY-019: Middleware (logging, recovery, request ID)
- BR-GATEWAY-020: HTTP response codes (201/202/400/500)
- BR-GATEWAY-022: Error handling
- BR-GATEWAY-023: Request validation

### **Key Deliverables**
1. `pkg/gateway/processing/crd_creator.go` - Create RemediationRequest CRDs
2. `pkg/gateway/server.go` - HTTP server with chi router
3. `pkg/gateway/middleware/` - Logging, recovery, request ID middlewares
4. `test/unit/gateway/server/` - 12-15 unit tests
5. **`pkg/gateway/server.go` - Wire Remediation Path Decider (NEW from v2.15)**

### **Processing Pipeline** (NEW from v2.15)
```
Signal → Adapter → Environment Classifier → Priority Engine → Remediation Path Decider → CRD Creator
```

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ CRDs created successfully
- ✅ HTTP 201/202/400/500 codes correct
- ✅ **Remediation Path Decider integrated and functional**
- ✅ Middleware active
- ✅ 85%+ test coverage

## 🔍 **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

### Phase 1: Code Existence (15 minutes)
- [ ] Check `pkg/gateway/processing/crd_creator.go` exists
- [ ] Check `pkg/gateway/server.go` exists
- [ ] Check `pkg/gateway/middleware/` directory exists
- [ ] Check test files exist
- [ ] **Verify Remediation Path Decider integration in server.go**

### Phase 2: Compilation (15 minutes)
- [ ] Build crd_creator.go
- [ ] Build server.go
- [ ] Build middleware files
- [ ] Check for lint errors
- [ ] Verify zero compilation errors

### Phase 3: Test Validation (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run CRD creation tests
- [ ] Run HTTP server tests
- [ ] Run middleware tests
- [ ] Verify test count (target: 12-15 tests)
- [ ] Check test coverage (target: 85%+)
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Verify Remediation Path Decider wired in server constructor**
- [ ] Check Environment Classifier integration
- [ ] Check Priority Engine integration
- [ ] Check CRD Creator integration
- [ ] Verify full pipeline: Signal → Adapter → Env → Priority → Path → CRD

### Phase 5: Business Requirements (30 minutes)
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-015: CRD creation ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-017: HTTP server ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-018: Webhook handlers ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-019: Middleware ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-020: HTTP response codes ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-022: Error handling ✅
- [ ] BR-GATEWAY-023: Request validation ✅

## 🎯 **EXPECTED FINDINGS**

Based on Day 4 validation:

### Likely Complete ✅
- CRD Creator implementation
- HTTP Server implementation
- Middleware implementation
- Test files

### Known Gap from Day 4 ⚠️
- **Remediation Path Decider NOT integrated** (v2.15 addresses this)
- Need to verify if integration was completed

### Potential Issues ⚠️
- Server constructor API changes
- Integration test helper mismatches (already documented)
- Test coverage gaps

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 - Code Existence Check
