# Proactive Signal Name Mappings
# BR-SP-106: Proactive Signal Mode Classification
# ADR-054: Proactive Signal Mode Classification and Prompt Strategy
#
# Maps proactive signal names to their base names for workflow catalog normalization.
# Signals matching a key are classified as "proactive" with signalMode = "proactive".
# Signals NOT in this map default to "reactive" with signalMode = "reactive".
#
# This file supports hot-reload (BR-SP-072 pattern): changes are picked up
# automatically without restarting the SignalProcessing controller.
#
# Format: <ProactiveSignalName>: <BaseSignalName>
#
# Convention: Prometheus predict_linear() alerts use the "Predicted" prefix.
# Operators can add mappings for any signal source naming convention.
