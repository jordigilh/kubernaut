# Premium Cursor Shortcuts Guide

**Generated**: 2025-01-28
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Production Ready

## Overview

The kubernaut project uses a streamlined set of **3 premium shortcuts** that combine evidence-based analyze-first methodology with systematic APDC (Analysis-Plan-Do-Check) execution. This guide provides comprehensive documentation for using these shortcuts effectively.

## Philosophy

**Evidence-Based Development**: All shortcuts follow the analyze-first principle to prevent unnecessary work through comprehensive analysis before implementation.

**Systematic Quality**: Each shortcut integrates APDC methodology to ensure systematic development with built-in quality assurance.

**Prevention Over Reaction**: Focus on preventing issues through proper analysis and planning rather than reactive fixes.

## The 3 Premium Shortcuts

### 1. `/develop` - Integrated Development Workflow ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Purpose**: Complete evidence-based development workflow for new features and complex enhancements

**When to Use**:
- ‚úÖ New feature development with unclear requirements
- ‚úÖ Enhancement requests that might already be solved
- ‚úÖ Complex functionality requiring systematic approach
- ‚úÖ Cross-component integration work
- ‚úÖ Any development where "do we really need this?" applies

**When NOT to Use**:
- ‚ùå Simple bug fixes with clear scope
- ‚ùå Documentation-only changes
- ‚ùå Configuration updates
- ‚ùå Emergency hotfixes (use `/fix-build`)

**Key Features**:
- üîç **Evidence-Based Analysis** (5-15 min): Comprehensive requirement validation and context understanding
- üìã **Strategic Planning** (10-20 min): Detailed implementation strategy with TDD phase mapping
- ‚ö° **Controlled Implementation** (Variable): Systematic TDD execution following approved plan
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Validation** (5-10 min): Business + technical verification with confidence assessment

**Workflow Phases**:
1. **ANALYSIS**: Mandatory analyze-first protocol with gap assessment
2. **PLAN**: Strategic planning with user approval requirement
3. **DO**: APDC-enhanced TDD (Discovery ‚Üí RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
4. **CHECK**: Comprehensive validation and confidence assessment

### 2. `/fix-build` - Evidence-Based Build Fix ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Purpose**: Premium build fixing combining analyze-first methodology with systematic APDC execution

**When to Use**:
- ‚úÖ Build errors and compilation issues
- ‚úÖ Undefined symbol errors
- ‚úÖ Import and dependency problems
- ‚úÖ Type definition issues
- ‚úÖ Integration failures

**When NOT to Use**:
- ‚ùå Runtime errors (use `/develop` for complex analysis)
- ‚ùå Performance issues
- ‚ùå Logic bugs in working code

**Key Features**:
- üîç **Evidence-Based Error Analysis** (5-10 min): Comprehensive error context + existing solutions check
- üìã **TDD Strategy + Rule Integration** (5-10 min): Plan with user approval requirement
- ‚ö° **Controlled Implementation + Checkpoints** (Variable): Systematic remediation with continuous validation
- ‚úÖ **Validation + Rule Compliance** (5 min): Technical + rule compliance verification

**Methodology**:
- **Analyze-First**: Search existing solutions before implementing anything
- **Gap Assessment**: Distinguish between missing imports vs missing implementation
- **Evidence-Based Strategy**: Reuse ‚Üí Enhance ‚Üí Create (priority order)
- **Mandatory Checkpoints**: Type validation, function validation, integration validation

### 3. `/refactor` - Evidence-Based Code Refactoring ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Purpose**: Premium refactoring combining analyze-first methodology with systematic APDC execution

**When to Use**:
- ‚úÖ Code quality improvements
- ‚úÖ Technical debt reduction
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization
- ‚úÖ Maintainability enhancements
- ‚úÖ Architecture improvements

**When NOT to Use**:
- ‚ùå New feature development (use `/develop`)
- ‚ùå Bug fixes (use `/fix-build` for build issues)
- ‚ùå Simple formatting changes

**Key Features**:
- üîç **Evidence-Based Impact Assessment** (10-15 min): Comprehensive refactoring analysis + existing pattern research
- üìã **Enhancement Strategy + Rule Integration** (15-20 min): Detailed plan with user approval requirement
- ‚ö° **Controlled Enhancement + Validation** (Variable): Systematic improvement with preserved functionality
- ‚úÖ **Quality Verification + Rule Compliance** (10 min): Enhancement validation with compliance report

**Enhancement Focus**:
- **Pattern Adoption**: Leverage existing better implementations instead of creating new
- **Preservation**: Maintain functionality while improving quality
- **Integration**: Ensure main application integration is preserved
- **Systematic**: Follow REFACTOR principles (enhance existing, don't create new)

## Usage Guidelines

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Shortcut | Reason |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **New feature request** | `/develop` | Full evidence-based analysis needed |
| **Build failing** | `/fix-build` | Systematic error resolution |
| **Code quality issues** | `/refactor` | Structured enhancement approach |
| **"The system should..."** | `/develop` | Business requirement analysis needed |
| **"Undefined symbol error"** | `/fix-build` | Build-specific systematic resolution |
| **"This code is messy"** | `/refactor` | Quality improvement focus |

### Best Practices

#### Before Using Any Shortcut:
1. **Clear Problem Statement**: Define what you're trying to achieve
2. **Business Context**: Understand the business value or requirement
3. **Time Availability**: Ensure you have time for the systematic approach
4. **Approval Authority**: Confirm you can approve plans during the process

#### During Shortcut Execution:
1. **Follow the Process**: Don't skip phases or rush analysis
2. **User Approval**: Always approve plans when prompted
3. **Validation**: Execute all checkpoints and validations
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear business requirement mapping

#### After Completion:
1. **Review Results**: Assess confidence levels and outcomes
2. **Integration Verification**: Confirm main application integration
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document lessons learned for team

### Success Metrics

**High-Quality Outcomes** (Target: 85%+ confidence):
- Business requirements clearly mapped and satisfied
- Technical implementation follows established patterns
- Integration with main applications verified
- Code quality meets or exceeds project standards
- Evidence-based approach prevented unnecessary work

**Process Efficiency**:
- Analysis phase prevents rework and wrong approaches
- Planning phase ensures clear direction and approval
- Implementation phase follows systematic quality approach
- Validation phase confirms successful completion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"The shortcut is too long/complex"**
- **Solution**: These are premium shortcuts designed for quality over speed
- **Alternative**: For simple changes, use standard development practices
- **Benefit**: Prevents larger issues and rework through systematic approach
