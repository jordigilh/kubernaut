## Action Distribution

‚ö†Ô∏è **Model shows bias toward scale_deployment action**
- `scale_deployment`: 10 actions (overused - model default response)
- `expand_pvc`: 3 actions (storage expansion)
- `rollback_deployment`: 1 action (deployment recovery)
- `quarantine_pod`: 1 action (security response) - **Missing expected quarantine**

## Performance vs Accuracy Analysis

### Performance Advantages ‚ö°
- **Total Runtime**: 18.62s vs 100.14s = **5.4x faster**
- **Average Response Time**: 0.85s vs 4.78s = **5.6x faster**
- **Max Response Time**: 1.34s vs 7.87s = **5.9x faster**
- **Model Size**: 1.4GB vs 5.0GB = **3.6x smaller**

### Accuracy Issues ‚ùå
- **Success Rate**: 77.8% vs 100% = **22.2% degradation**
- **Action Diversity**: Limited - overuses scale_deployment
- **Context Understanding**: Struggles with specialized scenarios (security, maintenance, diagnostics)
- **Nuanced Reasoning**: Less sophisticated decision making

## Failed Test Analysis

### 1. NodeMaintenanceRequired (Expected: drain_node, Got: scale_deployment)
- **Issue**: Model doesn't understand node maintenance concepts
- **Reasoning**: "NodeMaintenanceRequired alert indicates that the worker-02 node requires maintenance and should be drained. This is a critical situation as it could potentially impact the overall system's availability"
- **Problem**: Correct reasoning but wrong action selection

### 2. SecurityThreatDetected (Expected: quarantine_pod, Got: scale_deployment)  
- **Issue**: Model treats security threats as performance issues
- **Reasoning**: Model focused on "system availability" rather than security isolation
- **Impact**: Critical security vulnerability in real-world scenarios

### 3. ComplexTroubleshooting (Expected: collect_diagnostics, Got: scale_deployment)
- **Issue**: Model defaults to scaling instead of investigation
- **Reasoning**: Lacks understanding of diagnostic collection needs
- **Impact**: Would mask problems instead of investigating root causes

### 4. LowSeverityDiskSpace (Expected: notify_only/expand_pvc, Got: scale_deployment)
- **Issue**: Inappropriate scaling for storage issues
- **Reasoning**: Conflates load with storage problems
- **Impact**: Doesn't address underlying storage constraints

### 5. NetworkConnectivityIssue (Expected: restart_pod, Got: scale_deployment)
- **Issue**: Network problems treated as capacity issues
- **Reasoning**: Missing targeted troubleshooting approach
- **Impact**: Ineffective resolution for connectivity problems

## Token Usage Comparison

- **MoE 1B**: 631-687 total tokens per request
- **Dense 8B**: 599-766 total tokens per request
- **Difference**: Similar token usage, but much faster processing

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ‚ö° **Exceptional Speed**: 5.6x faster response times
- üíæ **Resource Efficiency**: 3.6x smaller model size
- ‚úÖ **Basic Scenarios**: Handles simple scaling/resource scenarios well
- üîÑ **Consistency**: Reliable for deployment and resource management

### Weaknesses  
- üéØ **Limited Action Repertoire**: Overreliance on scale_deployment
- üîí **Security Blindness**: Fails to recognize security-specific responses
- üîß **Operational Gaps**: Missing maintenance and diagnostic capabilities
- üß† **Context Sensitivity**: Less nuanced understanding of alert types

## Recommendations

### When to Use MoE 1B
- ‚úÖ High-frequency, simple scaling decisions
- ‚úÖ Performance-critical environments requiring sub-second responses  
- ‚úÖ Resource-constrained deployments
- ‚úÖ Basic alert triage and initial response

### When to Use Dense 8B
- ‚úÖ Security-sensitive environments
- ‚úÖ Complex operational scenarios requiring nuanced decisions
- ‚úÖ Production systems requiring high accuracy
- ‚úÖ Scenarios involving maintenance, diagnostics, or specialized actions

## Conclusion

The granite3.1-moe:1b model offers significant performance advantages (5.6x faster) but at the cost of decision accuracy and sophistication. It shows a clear bias toward scaling solutions and lacks the contextual understanding needed for specialized scenarios like security threats, node maintenance, and complex troubleshooting.

For production use, consider a hybrid approach:
- Use MoE 1B for initial rapid triage and common scaling scenarios
- Escalate complex, security, or maintenance scenarios to Dense 8B
- Implement confidence thresholds to trigger model selection
