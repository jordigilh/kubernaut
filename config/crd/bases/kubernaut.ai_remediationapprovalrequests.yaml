          RemediationApprovalRequest is the Schema for the remediationapprovalrequests API.

          ADR-040: RemediationApprovalRequest CRD Architecture
          - Follows Kubernetes CertificateSigningRequest pattern (immutable spec, mutable status)
          - Owned by RemediationRequest (flat hierarchy per ADR-001)
          - AIAnalysis controller uses field index on spec.aiAnalysisRef.name for efficient lookup
          - Timeout expiration handled by dedicated controller

          Lifecycle:
          1. RO creates when AIAnalysis.status.approvalRequired=true
          2. Operator approves/rejects via status.conditions update
          3. Dedicated controller detects decision or timeout
          4. AIAnalysis controller watches and transitions phase accordingly

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.
