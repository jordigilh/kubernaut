// ========================================
// PHASE TRANSITION DECISION LOGIC
// 📋 Extracted from internal/controller/notification (determinePhaseTransition)
// ========================================
//
// This file contains the pure business logic for determining phase transitions
// based on delivery results and channel states. It is independent of K8s
// persistence, metrics, or audit concerns.
//
// The controller delegates to DetermineTransition() for the decision, then
// handles the K8s persistence (AtomicStatusUpdate, metrics, audit) itself.
//
// Business Requirements:
// - BR-NOT-053: At-Least-Once Delivery
// - BR-NOT-054: Delivery Retry with Exponential Backoff
// - NT-BUG-003: Check for partial success before marking as Failed
// - NT-BUG-005: Handle partial success correctly during retry loop
// - NT-BUG-006: PartiallySent vs Retrying Phase Confusion
// ========================================

// DeliveryResult contains the results of a delivery loop for phase transition determination.
type DeliveryResult struct {
	// ChannelResults maps channel name to delivery error (nil = success)
	ChannelResults map[string]error

	// FailureCount is the number of channels that failed in this delivery loop
	FailureCount int

	// DeliveryAttempts from this delivery loop (used to count new successes)
	DeliveryAttempts []notificationv1.DeliveryAttempt
}

// ChannelState provides pre-computed state information about a delivery channel.
// The controller builds this from its helper methods before calling DetermineTransition.
type ChannelState struct {
	// AlreadySucceeded indicates the channel has already delivered successfully
	// (from persisted status + in-memory tracking)
	AlreadySucceeded bool

	// AttemptCount is the total number of delivery attempts for this channel
	// (persisted + in-flight)
	AttemptCount int

	// HasPermanentError indicates the channel has a non-retryable error
	HasPermanentError bool
}

// TransitionDecision contains the result of phase transition determination.
type TransitionDecision struct {
	// NextPhase is the determined next phase for the notification.
	// When PhaseUnchanged is true, this holds the current phase (no transition).
	NextPhase Phase

	// Reason is the machine-readable reason for the transition
	Reason string

	// Message is a human-readable description of the transition
	Message string

	// IsTerminal indicates if the next phase is a terminal state (Sent, PartiallySent, Failed)
	IsTerminal bool

	// ShouldRequeue indicates if the notification should be requeued for retry
	ShouldRequeue bool

	// PhaseUnchanged indicates no phase transition occurs (stay in current phase)
	PhaseUnchanged bool

	// IsPermanentFailure indicates this is a permanent failure (all retries exhausted)
	// Used by the controller to distinguish permanent vs temporary failure handling
	IsPermanentFailure bool

	// MaxFailedAttemptCount is the maximum attempt count among failed channels.
	// Used by the caller to calculate exponential backoff duration.
	MaxFailedAttemptCount int
}

// DetermineTransition determines the next phase based on delivery results and channel states.
//
// This function encodes the pure business logic for phase transition decisions,
// independent of K8s persistence, metrics, or audit concerns.
//
// Parameters:
//   - notification: The notification being processed (read-only, for status access)
//   - channels: The resolved delivery channels (from routing rules)
//   - result: The delivery loop results
//   - channelStates: Map of channel name to pre-computed ChannelState
//   - maxAttempts: Maximum retry attempts from the retry policy
//
// The caller is responsible for:
//   - Resolving channels from routing rules
//   - Building channelStates from its helper methods (channelAlreadySucceeded, etc.)
//   - Executing the K8s persistence based on the returned decision
//   - Calculating backoff duration using MaxFailedAttemptCount
