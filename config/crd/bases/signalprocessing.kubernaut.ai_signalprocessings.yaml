                      OwnerChain: K8s ownership traversal from signal source resource
                      DD-WORKFLOW-001 v1.7: Used by HolmesGPT-API for 100% safe DetectedLabels validation
                      SignalProcessing traverses metadata.ownerReferences to build this chain
                      Example: Pod → ReplicaSet → Deployment
                      Empty chain = orphan resource (no owners)
                      HolmesGPT-API uses this to validate DetectedLabels applicability when RCA
                      identifies a different resource than the original signal source
