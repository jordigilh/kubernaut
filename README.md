# Kubernaut

**AI-Powered Kubernetes Operations Platform**

Kubernaut is an open-source Kubernetes AIOps platform that combines AI-driven investigation with automated remediation. It analyzes Kubernetes incidents, orchestrates multi-step remediation workflows, and executes validated actions—targeting mean time to resolution reduction from 60 minutes to under 5 minutes while maintaining operational safety.

---

## 🎯 What is Kubernaut?

Kubernaut automates the entire incident response lifecycle for Kubernetes:

1. **Signal Ingestion**: Receives alerts from Prometheus AlertManager and Kubernetes Events
2. **AI Analysis**: Uses HolmesGPT for root cause analysis and remediation recommendations
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Executes multi-step remediation playbooks via Tekton Pipelines
4. **Continuous Learning**: Tracks effectiveness and improves recommendations over time

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Source Signal Processing**: Prometheus alerts, Kubernetes events, with deduplication and storm detection
- **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis**: HolmesGPT integration for intelligent investigation
- **Remediation Playbooks**: Industry-standard, versioned remediation patterns (PagerDuty/Google SRE-aligned)
- **Safety-First Execution**: Comprehensive validation, dry-run mode, and rollback capabilities
- **Continuous Learning**: Multi-dimensional effectiveness tracking (incident type, playbook, action)
- **Production-Ready**: 289 tests passing, 95% confidence across all services

## 🏗️ Architecture

Kubernaut follows a microservices architecture with 11 services (4 CRD controllers + 7 stateless services):

![Kubernaut Layered Architecture](docs/architecture/diagrams/kubernaut-layered-architecture.svg)

### Architecture Flow

1. **Gateway Service** receives signals (Prometheus alerts, K8s events) and creates `RemediationRequest` CRDs
2. **Remediation Orchestrator** coordinates the lifecycle across 4 specialized CRD controllers:
   - **Signal Processing**: Enriches signals with Kubernetes context
   - **AI Analysis**: Performs HolmesGPT investigation and generates recommendations
   - **Remediation Execution**: Orchestrates Tekton Pipelines for multi-step workflows
   - **Notification**: Delivers multi-channel notifications (Slack, Email, etc.)
3. **Data Storage Service** provides centralized PostgreSQL access (ADR-032)
4. **Effectiveness Monitor** tracks outcomes and feeds learning back to AI

### Communication Pattern

Kubernaut uses **Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs)** for all inter-service communication, enabling:
- Event-driven, resilient workflows
- Built-in retry and reconciliation
- Complete audit trail
- Horizontal scaling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23.9+** for building services
- **Kubernetes cluster** (Kind recommended for development)
- **Redis** (for Gateway service deduplication)
- **PostgreSQL** (for data persistence)
- **kubectl** with cluster access

### Build and Run

```bash
# Install CRDs
make install

# Build all CRD controllers (single binary for development)
make build
# Creates: bin/manager (includes all CRD controllers)

# Build individual services
go build -o bin/gateway-service ./cmd/gateway
go build -o bin/dynamic-toolset ./cmd/dynamictoolset
go build -o bin/data-storage ./cmd/datastorage
go build -o bin/context-api ./cmd/contextapi
```

### Testing

```bash
# Setup Kind cluster for testing
make test-gateway-setup

# Run tests by tier
make test                      # Unit tests (70%+ coverage)
make test-integration          # Integration tests (>50% coverage)
make test-e2e                  # End-to-end tests (<10% coverage)

# Clean up
make test-gateway-teardown
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Kubernaut follows a **defense-in-depth testing pyramid**:

- **Unit Tests**: **70%+ coverage** - Extensive business logic with external mocks only
- **Integration Tests**: **20% coverage** - Cross-service coordination, CRD-based flows
- **E2E Tests**: **<10% coverage** - Critical end-to-end user journeys

**Current Test Status**: 1,060+ unit tests passing (100% pass rate)

| Service | Unit Specs | Integration Specs | E2E Specs | Total | Confidence |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Gateway v1.0** | 105 | 114 | - | **219** | **100%** |
| **Context API v1.0** | 98 | ~50 | - | **~148** | **100%** |
| **Data Storage** | 475 | ~60 | - | **~535** | **98%** |
| **Dynamic Toolset v1.0** | 194 | 38 | 13 | **245** | **100%** |
| **Notification Service** | 83 | ~10 | - | **~93** | **95%** |
| **HolmesGPT API v3.0.1** | 153 | 19 | - | **172** | **98%** |

**Total**: ~1,108 unit specs + ~291 integration specs + 13 E2E specs = **~1,412 test specs**

*Note: Integration spec counts are estimates. Gateway has exact count (114 specs), others estimated from file counts.*

## 🛡️ Security

### RBAC Configuration

Each CRD controller requires specific Kubernetes permissions. See [RBAC documentation](docs/architecture/APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md#security-considerations) for details.

### Service-to-Service Authentication

- **Gateway Service**: Network-level security (NetworkPolicies + TLS)
- **CRD Controllers**: Kubernetes ServiceAccount authentication
- **Inter-service**: Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) with mTLS

---
