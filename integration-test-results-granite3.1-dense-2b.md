## Performance vs Accuracy Analysis

### Performance Advantages ‚ö°
- **Total Runtime**: 41.07s vs 100.14s = **2.4x faster than 8B**
- **Average Response Time**: 1.94s vs 4.78s = **2.5x faster than 8B**
- **Max Response Time**: 3.00s vs 7.87s = **2.6x faster than 8B**
- **Model Size**: 1.6GB vs 5.0GB = **3.1x smaller than 8B**

### Accuracy Excellence ‚≠ê
- **Success Rate**: 94.4% vs 100% (8B) = **Only 5.6% degradation**
- **Action Diversity**: Excellent - uses full range of available actions
- **Context Understanding**: Strong performance on complex scenarios
- **Security Awareness**: Perfect security threat response

## Failed Test Analysis

### NetworkConnectivityIssue (Expected: restart_pod, Got: scale_deployment)
- **Issue**: Model treats network connectivity as a load/capacity issue
- **Reasoning**: "network connectivity issues with the backend service, which could be due to high traffic or temporary network glitches. Scaling up the deployment replicas might help distribute the load"
- **Assessment**: Logical but suboptimal - scaling doesn't fix network connectivity problems
- **Impact**: Minor - would be ineffective but not harmful

## Token Usage Analysis

## Deployment Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: **Dense 2B for Production** üéØ

**Reasoning**:
1. **Optimal Balance**: Best speed/accuracy tradeoff in the model lineup
2. **Production Ready**: 94.4% accuracy sufficient for automated remediation
3. **Resource Efficient**: 3x smaller than 8B, easy to deploy
4. **Comprehensive**: Handles all scenario types including security and complex operations
5. **Performance**: Fast enough for production alert response times

### Fallback Strategy
- **Use Dense 8B only when**: Absolute perfection required (mission-critical systems)
- **Use MoE 1B only for**: Development/testing or simple scaling scenarios

## Conclusion

The **granite3.1-dense:2b model represents the optimal choice** for production Kubernetes environments. It provides:

- ‚ö° **Excellent Performance**: 2.5x faster than 8B model
- üéØ **Near-Perfect Accuracy**: 94.4% success rate with only minor network logic gap  
- üîí **Security Awareness**: Perfect handling of security threats
- üîß **Operational Sophistication**: Complete action repertoire for complex scenarios
- üíæ **Resource Efficiency**: 3x smaller memory footprint than 8B model

The single failure (network connectivity treated as scaling issue) represents a minor operational inefficiency rather than a critical failure, making this model the ideal balance point for production deployments.
