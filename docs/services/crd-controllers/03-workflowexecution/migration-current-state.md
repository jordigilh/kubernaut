## Current State & Migration Path

### Existing Business Logic (Verified)

**Current Location**: `pkg/workflow/` (existing workflow engine code)
**Target Location**: `pkg/workflow/execution/` (for workflow execution logic)

```
Reusable Components:
pkg/workflow/
├── engine/              → Workflow engine interfaces
├── templates/           → Workflow template management
└── steps/              → Step execution logic
```

**Existing Tests** (Verified - to be extended):
- `test/unit/workflow/` → `test/unit/workflowexecution/` - Unit tests with Ginkgo/Gomega
- `test/integration/workflow/` → `test/integration/workflowexecution/` - Integration tests

### Implementation Gap Analysis

**What Exists (Verified)**:
- ✅ Workflow engine interfaces and step definitions
- ✅ Template management and versioning
- ✅ Basic step execution logic
- ✅ Workflow state management

**What's Missing (CRD V1 Requirements)**:
- ❌ WorkflowExecution CRD schema (need to create)
- ❌ WorkflowExecutionReconciler controller (need to create)
- ❌ Multi-phase orchestration (planning, validating, executing, monitoring)
- ❌ Safety validation and dry-run capabilities
- ❌ Rollback strategy implementation
- ❌ KubernetesExecution CRD creation and monitoring
- ❌ Adaptive orchestration based on runtime conditions
- ❌ Watch-based step coordination

**Estimated Migration Effort**: 10-12 days (2 weeks)
- Day 1-2: CRD schema + controller skeleton + TDD planning
- Day 3-4: Planning and validation phases
- Day 5-7: Execution phase with step orchestration
- Day 8-9: Monitoring phase and rollback logic
- Day 10-11: Integration testing with Executor Service
- Day 12: E2E testing and documentation
