### **Red Hat-Specific Adoption Timeline**

| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Red Hat Role** | **Customer Experience** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | 1-2 weeks | Account manager intro | "What is Kubernaut? How does it help us?" |
| **Evaluation** | 30 days | Trial license, demo environment | "Let's test it on dev cluster" |
| **Pilot** | 2-4 weeks | TSM assigned, technical validation | "Deploy to 1 production cluster" |
| **Expansion** | 3-6 months | Support integration, rollout planning | "Deploy to all OpenShift clusters" |
| **Upsell** | Ongoing | Account manager, KB agent pitch | "Add OpenShift-specific knowledge" |

---

### **Why This Works for Red Hat**

1. **✅ Low Friction**: Bundled with Platform Plus (no separate procurement)
2. **✅ Integrated Support**: Red Hat handles L1/L2, seamless customer experience
3. **✅ Upsell Path**: Lightspeed KB Agent is natural upgrade (20-30% target)
4. **✅ Account Expansion**: Kubernaut creates more Platform Plus value
5. **✅ Competitive Defense**: Makes OpenShift stickier vs. EKS, GKE, AKS

---

### **Customer Success Metrics (Red Hat Tracking)**

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Measurement** |
|---|---|---|
| **Trial → Pilot Conversion** | 40% | % of trials deploying to production |
| **Pilot → Full Adoption** | 70% | % of pilots expanding multi-cluster |
| **KB Agent Upsell** | 20-30% | % of customers adding Lightspeed KB |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | NPS 50+ | Quarterly NPS surveys |
| **MTTR Improvement** | 80%+ reduction | Before/after MTTR metrics |

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

> **"Kubernaut's adoption funnel is designed for low-friction growth:**
>
> **Upstream: Open source drives awareness → Self-hosted trials prove value → Enterprise features drive revenue.**
>
> **Downstream (Red Hat): Platform Plus bundle → Single-cluster pilots → Multi-cluster expansion → Lightspeed KB upsell.**
>
> **Target: 800-1,200 OpenShift customers by Year 3, 20-30% KB Agent adoption = $60-90M ARR."**
