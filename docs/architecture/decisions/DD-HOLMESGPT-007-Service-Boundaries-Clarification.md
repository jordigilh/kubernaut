# DD-HOLMESGPT-007: Service Boundaries and Failure Recovery Flow Clarification

**Service**: HolmesGPT API Service
**Decision Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED & DOCUMENTED**
**Type**: Architecture/Boundaries
**Impact**: Critical architectural clarification preventing implementation errors

---

## Quick Summary

**Situation**: Misunderstanding about how HolmesGPT API receives failure context during recovery flow

**Issue**: Initial explanation implied HolmesGPT API tracks workflow execution and knows when steps fail

**Decision**: **CLARIFY**: HolmesGPT API is a **PURE ANALYSIS SERVICE** that receives failure context AS INPUT (not tracked internally)

**Impact**: Prevents architectural violations, ensures correct implementation of recovery endpoints

---

## Decision

**MANDATE**: HolmesGPT API is a **stateless HTTP analysis service** that receives ALL context (including failure details) AS INPUT from callers (AIAnalysis Controller). It does NOT watch, track, or manage execution.

**Architectural Principle**: **"Receive context as INPUT, return analysis as OUTPUT"** - No tracking, no CRD watches, no orchestration.

---

## Context

### The Misunderstanding

**Original Explanation** (for E2E test `test_recovery_api_sequence.py`):
```
"The test simulates HolmesGPT API tracking execution and detecting failures..."
```

**Problem**: This implies HolmesGPT API:
- ❌ Tracks workflow execution status
- ❌ Knows when steps fail
- ❌ Monitors execution progress
- ❌ Watches Kubernetes CRDs

**Reality**: HolmesGPT API does NONE of these things.

### User Correction

**User Statement**:
> "review the approved architecture design and reassess the complete flow shows here. I see a reference to the workflow execution and I fear this is being managed by the holmesGPT-api, which is incorrect as per architecture"

**Reference Documents**:
- `docs/architecture/PROPOSED_FAILURE_RECOVERY_SEQUENCE.md` (Authoritative)
- `docs/architecture/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` (DD-001: Context enrichment)
- `docs/architecture/STEP_FAILURE_RECOVERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Service Responsibility Matrix

### HolmesGPT API (THIS SERVICE)

**DOES** ✅:
- Receive HTTP investigation requests (from AIAnalysis Controller)
- Receive failure context AS INPUT (in HTTP request body)
- Pass context to LLM
- Orchestrate LLM tool calls (Context API, Kubernetes, logs) when LLM requests
- Generate analysis results (root cause, recommendations)
- Return analysis as JSON (HTTP response)

**DOES NOT** ❌:
- Watch Kubernetes CRDs
- Detect workflow failures
- Track execution status
- Know about execution progress
- Create recovery CRDs
- Orchestrate workflows
- Execute Kubernetes actions
- Manage remediation lifecycle
- Store execution history (except logs)

**Analogy**: HolmesGPT API is like a **medical lab** - it receives samples (HTTP requests), runs tests (AI analysis), returns diagnosis (recommendations). It does NOT treat patients (execute), schedule follow-ups (orchestrate), or manage medical records (store history).

---

### RemediationOrchestrator Controller (NOT HolmesGPT API)

**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Watch WorkflowExecution CRD status changes
- ✅ Detect "failed" status
- ✅ Evaluate recovery viability (attempts < 3, pattern check, rate check)
- ✅ Create NEW RemediationProcessing CRD (with failure details in spec)
- ✅ Create NEW AIAnalysis CRD (after RemediationProcessing enrichment)
- ✅ Track recovery attempts in RemediationRequest status
- ✅ Enforce recovery limits (max 3 attempts)

---

### RemediationProcessing Controller (NOT HolmesGPT API)

**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Watch RemediationProcessing CRD
- ✅ Enrich with FRESH monitoring + business contexts
- ✅ Enrich with recovery context (failure details from spec)
- ✅ Query Context API for historical similar failures
- ✅ Update status with ALL enriched contexts

---

### AIAnalysis Controller (NOT HolmesGPT API)

**Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Watch AIAnalysis CRD
- ✅ Read ALL contexts from CRD spec (including recovery context)
- ✅ Call HolmesGPT API with enriched context
- ✅ Store recommendations in CRD status

**Key Point**: AIAnalysis Controller PASSES failure context to HolmesGPT API (HolmesGPT doesn't find it).

---

## Data Flow: How Failure Details Reach HolmesGPT API

### Step-by-Step Data Flow

```
1. KubernetesExecution CRD status:
   {
     "phase": "failed",
     "actionType": "restart_pods",
     "error": "Pod terminated: OOMKilled"
   }

2. WorkflowExecution CRD status:
   {
     "phase": "failed",
     "failedStep": 3,
     "failureReason": "OOMKilled",
     "kubernetesExecutionRef": "ke-001"
   }

3. RemediationProcessing CRD spec (created by RemediationOrchestrator):
   {
     "isRecoveryAttempt": true,
     "attemptNumber": 1,
     "failedWorkflowRef": "wf-001",
     "failedStep": 3,
     "failureReason": "OOMKilled"
   }

4. RemediationProcessing CRD status (after enrichment):
   {
     "phase": "completed",
     "monitoringContext": {...},
     "businessContext": {...},
     "recoveryContext": {
       "isRecoveryAttempt": true,
       "attemptNumber": 1,
       "failedAction": "restart_pods",
       "failureReason": "OOMKilled",
       "failedStep": 3,
       "previousAttempts": [...]  ← From Context API query
     }
   }

5. AIAnalysis CRD spec (created by RemediationOrchestrator):
   {
     "analysisRequest": {
       "signalContext": {...},
       "monitoringContext": {...},     ← From RP status
       "businessContext": {...},       ← From RP status
       "recoveryContext": {...}        ← From RP status (WITH FAILURE DETAILS)
     }
   }

6. HolmesGPT API HTTP request (from AIAnalysis Controller):
   POST /api/v1/investigate {
     "alert_context": {...},
     "monitoring_context": {...},
     "business_context": {...},
     "recovery_context": {           ← FAILURE DETAILS RECEIVED AS INPUT
       "is_recovery_attempt": true,
       "failed_action": "restart_pods",
       "failure_reason": "OOMKilled",
       ...
     }
   }
```

**Key Principle**: Failure details flow through **CRD chain** → RemediationProcessing enrichment → AIAnalysis spec → AIAnalysis Controller → **HolmesGPT API receives as INPUT**.

HolmesGPT API does NOT:
- ❌ Read from CRDs (stateless HTTP service)
- ❌ Watch for failures (CRD controllers do this)
- ❌ Track execution status (RemediationOrchestrator does this)

---

## Impact on Implementation

### ✅ Implementation Plan is CORRECT

**Finding**: The implementation plan (DAY2_PLAN_COMPLETE.md) was ALREADY correct.

**Evidence** (lines 332-333):
```python
@router.post("/recovery/analyze", response_model=RecoveryResponse)
async def analyze_recovery(request: RecoveryRequest, user=Depends(require_auth)):
    """
    BR-HAPI-RECOVERY-001: Analyze failure and generate recovery strategies

    This is ANALYSIS ONLY - no execution
    Actual recovery execution is handled by Kubernaut Action Executors
    """
```

**Assessment**: ✅ No code changes needed - plan correctly emphasizes analysis role.

---

### ✅ E2E Test Strategy is CORRECT

**Test Purpose**: Validate HolmesGPT API can generate recovery strategies when GIVEN failure context.

**What E2E Tests DO**:
- ✅ Simulate AIAnalysis Controller calling HolmesGPT API
- ✅ Provide failure context as input (simulating what AIAnalysis Controller sends)
- ✅ Validate recovery strategy generation
- ✅ Validate risk assessment accuracy

**What E2E Tests Do NOT Do**:
- ❌ Test workflow orchestration (controller responsibility)
- ❌ Test failure detection (controller watches)
- ❌ Test CRD creation (RemediationOrchestrator responsibility)
- ❌ Test execution tracking (HolmesGPT doesn't track)

**Test Naming Clarification**:
- RENAMED: `test_recovery_flow.py` → `test_recovery_api_sequence.py`
- RENAMED: `test_safety_flow.py` → `test_safety_api_sequence.py`
- REASON: "flow" implies workflow orchestration; "api_sequence" clarifies scope

---

## Common Misconceptions (CORRECTED)

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API orchestrates remediation"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "CRD controllers orchestrate remediation and CALL HolmesGPT API for analysis"

---

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API creates Kubernetes CRDs"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "HolmesGPT API is a pure HTTP service that returns analysis results as JSON"

---

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API executes workflow steps"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "KubernetesExecution controller executes steps; HolmesGPT API only provides recommendations"

---

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API watches CRD status"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "HolmesGPT API is stateless and doesn't interact with Kubernetes API except for investigation toolsets"

---

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API manages recovery lifecycle"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "RemediationOrchestrator manages recovery; HolmesGPT API only generates recovery strategies when asked"

---

### ❌ **WRONG**: "HolmesGPT API tracks execution"
### ✅ **CORRECT**: "HolmesGPT API receives failure context AS INPUT from AIAnalysis Controller"

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: HolmesGPT API as Active Orchestrator ❌

**Approach**: HolmesGPT API watches CRDs, detects failures, creates recovery CRDs

**Rejected Because**:
- ❌ Violates microservices separation of concerns
- ❌ Requires HolmesGPT to be stateful (CRD watches)
- ❌ Cannot horizontally scale (watch conflicts)
- ❌ Tight coupling with Kubernetes API
- ❌ Python service managing Go controller responsibilities

---

### Option B: HolmesGPT API as Passive Analysis Service ✅ (APPROVED)

**Approach**: HolmesGPT API receives ALL context as INPUT, returns analysis as OUTPUT

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Stateless (horizontally scalable)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ CRD controllers manage orchestration (Go services)
- ✅ HolmesGPT focuses on AI analysis (Python SDK)
- ✅ Context enrichment happens in RemediationProcessing (consistent pattern)

**Selected**: ✅ This is the APPROVED architecture
