## ðŸ”¥ **Priority 1: Storm Aggregation (7 tests, 2-3h)**

### **Root Cause**
Storm aggregation logic is working but tests are failing due to:
1. CRD creation expectations
2. Affected resources list format
3. Concurrent aggregation timing
4. Mixed storm/non-storm handling

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Should create new storm CRD with single affected resource
2. âœ… Should update existing storm CRD with additional affected resources
3. âœ… Should create single CRD with 15 affected resources
4. âœ… Should deduplicate affected resources list
5. âœ… Should aggregate 15 concurrent Prometheus alerts into 1 storm CRD
6. âœ… Should handle mixed storm and non-storm alerts correctly
7. âœ… First alert in storm arrives

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Review storm aggregation CRD creation logic
2. Verify affected resources format matches expectations
3. Add proper timing/synchronization for concurrent tests
4. Fix mixed storm/non-storm routing logic

---

## ðŸ”¥ **Priority 2: Deduplication/TTL (4 tests, 1-1.5h)**

### **Root Cause**
TTL expiration and refresh logic issues:
1. TTL not expiring correctly
2. Duplicate counter not preserved
3. TTL refresh not working

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Treats expired fingerprint as new alert after 5-minute TTL
2. âœ… Uses configurable 5-minute TTL for deduplication window
3. âœ… Refreshes TTL on each duplicate detection
4. âœ… Preserves duplicate count until TTL expiration

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Review Redis TTL commands (EXPIRE, TTL)
2. Verify TTL refresh logic in deduplication service
3. Test TTL expiration with shorter timeouts
4. Fix duplicate counter persistence

---

## ðŸ”¥ **Priority 3: Redis Integration (10 tests, 2-2.5h)**

### **Root Cause**
Redis connectivity and state management issues:
1. Connection failure handling
2. State persistence
3. TTL expiration
4. Concurrent writes
5. Connection pool exhaustion
6. Cluster failover
7. Pipeline failures

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Should persist deduplication state in Redis
2. âœ… Should expire deduplication entries after TTL
3. âœ… Should handle Redis connection failure gracefully
4. âœ… Should store storm detection state in Redis
5. âœ… Should handle concurrent Redis writes without corruption
6. âœ… Should clean up Redis state on CRD deletion
7. âœ… Should handle Redis cluster failover without data loss
8. âœ… Should handle Redis pipeline command failures
9. âœ… Should handle Redis connection pool exhaustion
10. âœ… Respects context timeout when Redis is slow

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Add proper error handling for Redis failures
2. Implement graceful degradation (503 responses)
3. Fix state persistence and cleanup
4. Add connection pool management
5. Implement timeout handling

## ðŸ”¥ **Priority 4: K8s API Integration (10 tests, 2-2.5h)**

### **Root Cause**
K8s API interaction issues:
1. CRD creation failures
2. Metadata population
3. Rate limiting handling
4. Name collisions
5. Temporary failures
6. Quota exceeded
7. Name length limits
8. Watch connections
9. Slow responses
10. Concurrent creates

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Should create RemediationRequest CRD successfully
2. âœ… Should populate CRD with correct metadata
3. âœ… Should handle K8s API rate limiting
4. âœ… Should handle CRD name collisions
5. âœ… Should handle K8s API temporary failures with retry
6. âœ… Should handle K8s API quota exceeded gracefully
7. âœ… Should handle CRD name length limit (253 chars)
8. âœ… Should handle watch connection interruption
9. âœ… Should handle K8s API slow responses without timeout
10. âœ… Should handle concurrent CRD creates to same namespace

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Review CRD creation logic in `crd_creator.go`
2. Add proper error handling for K8s API failures
3. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Fix name generation for collisions
5. Add timeout handling for slow responses

## ðŸŸ¡ **Priority 5: E2E Webhook (6 tests, 1.5-2h)**

### **Root Cause**
End-to-end webhook processing issues:
1. CRD creation from Prometheus alerts
2. Resource information extraction
3. Deduplication workflow
4. Duplicate count tracking
5. Storm detection workflow
6. Kubernetes Event webhook

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Creates RemediationRequest CRD from Prometheus AlertManager webhook
2. âœ… Includes resource information for AI remediation targeting
3. âœ… Returns 202 Accepted for duplicate alerts within 5-minute window
4. âœ… Tracks duplicate count and timestamps in Redis metadata
5. âœ… Detects alert storm when 10+ alerts in 1 minute
6. âœ… Creates CRD from Kubernetes Event webhook

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Review end-to-end webhook handler logic
2. Fix resource information extraction
3. Verify deduplication workflow integration
4. Fix storm detection workflow integration
5. Add Kubernetes Event adapter support

## ðŸŸ¡ **Priority 6: Concurrent Processing (8 tests, 2-2.5h)**

### **Root Cause**
Concurrency and race condition issues:
1. 100 concurrent unique alerts
2. 100 identical concurrent alerts (deduplication)
3. 50 concurrent similar alerts (storm)
4. Mixed concurrent operations
5. Multiple namespaces
6. Race window duplicates
7. Varying payload sizes
8. Context cancellation
9. Burst traffic

### **Tests Failing**
1. âœ… Should handle 100 concurrent unique alerts
2. âœ… Should deduplicate 100 identical concurrent alerts
3. âœ… Should detect storm with 50 concurrent similar alerts
4. âœ… Should handle mixed concurrent operations (create + duplicate + storm)
5. âœ… Should handle concurrent requests across multiple namespaces
6. âœ… Should handle concurrent duplicates arriving within race window (<1ms)
7. âœ… Should handle concurrent requests with varying payload sizes
8. âœ… Should handle context cancellation during concurrent processing
9. âœ… Should handle burst traffic followed by idle period

### **Fix Strategy**
1. Review concurrency handling in Gateway server
2. Add proper locking/synchronization
3. Fix race conditions in deduplication
4. Fix race conditions in storm detection
5. Add proper context cancellation handling

1. Rate limiting
2. Retry-After header
3. Concurrent authenticated requests
4. Large payloads
5. Payload size limit
6. Complete security stack

### **Tests Failing**

- âœ… Zero lint errors
- âœ… All business logic working correctly
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Graceful degradation

**Status**: âœ… **READY TO START**
**Confidence**: 90%
**Justification**: Authentication is working, failures are well-categorized, fix strategies are clear, estimated time is realistic.

**Recommendation**: Start with Priority 1 (Storm Aggregation) as it has the highest impact and will unlock related tests.
