## 🔧 Go Code Standards (MANDATORY)

**Reference**: See `GO_CODE_STANDARDS_FOR_PLANS.md` for complete details

### All Go Code Blocks MUST Include

1. **Package Declaration**
   ```go
   package packagename
   ```

2. **Complete Import Statements**
   ```go
   import (
       "context"
       "fmt"
       "time"

       . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"
       . "github.com/onsi/gomega"

   ```

3. **All Helper Functions** (e.g., `ptrInt32`)
   ```go
   func ptrInt32(i int32) *int32 { return &i }
   ```

### Standard Import Sets

**Test Files**:
```go
import (
    "context"
    "testing"

    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
    metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client/fake"
)
```

**Integration Tests (Envtest)**:
```go
import (
    "context"
    "path/filepath"
    "testing"

    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"

    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest"
)
```

**Controllers**:
```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    apierrors "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors"
    metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
    ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/log"
)
```

### Import Validation

Before implementation, every code block verified for:
- ✅ No undefined symbols
- ✅ All CRD types imported with full path
- ✅ Helper functions defined or imported
- ✅ Standard library separated from third-party imports
- ✅ Proper import aliases (e.g., `ctrl`, `metav1`)

**Note**: Current expansion plans show structure; actual implementation will include complete imports per GO_CODE_STANDARDS_FOR_PLANS.md

## Shared Patterns Across All Plans

### 1. APDC Day Expansion Structure (Every Expanded Day)
```markdown
## 📅 Day X: [Topic] (8h)

### ANALYSIS Phase (1h)
- Codebase search commands
- Existing pattern discovery
- BR requirement mapping
- Dependency identification

### PLAN Phase (1h)
- TDD strategy (70% unit, >50% integration targets)
- Integration points
- Success criteria
- Timeline: RED (2h) → GREEN (3h) → REFACTOR (2h)

### DO-RED: Tests (2h)
[300-350 lines of complete Ginkgo test code]
- Describe blocks with BR references
- DescribeTable with 10-20+ entries
- Complete test expectations

### DO-GREEN: Implementation (3h)
[300-400 lines of production code]
- Minimal implementation
- Immediate integration
- Owner references

### DO-REFACTOR: Enhancement (2h)
[150-200 lines of optimized code]
- Performance improvements
- Advanced features
- Edge case handling
```

**Total per expanded day**: ~900 lines

---

### 2. Integration Test Structure (Every Service)
```go
var _ = Describe("Integration Test N: [Feature]", func() {
    var resource *v1alpha1.Resource
    var resourceName string

    BeforeEach(func() {
        // Setup with Envtest
        resourceName = "test-" + time.Now().Format("20060102150405")
    })

    AfterEach(func() {
        if resource != nil {
            _ = crClient.Delete(ctx, resource)
        }
    })

    It("should [business requirement outcome]", func() {
        By("Creating CRD with specific parameters")
        // [Full CRD creation ~30 lines]

        By("Waiting for controller to process")
        Eventually(func() PhaseType {
            // [Status polling ~20 lines]
        }, 30*time.Second, 2*time.Second).Should(Equal(ExpectedPhase))

        By("Verifying business outcome (not just technical success)")
        // [Detailed assertions ~40 lines]

        By("Verifying status tracking (audit trail)")
        // [Status field validation ~30 lines]

        GinkgoWriter.Printf("✅ [Feature] validated\n")
    })
})
```

**Total per test**: ~200 lines × 3 tests = ~600 lines per service

---

### 3. EOD Documentation Structure
```markdown
# Day X Complete: [Milestone]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: Days 1-X Complete (Y% of implementation)
**Confidence**: Z%

## Accomplishments (Days 1-X)
[Day-by-day summary with ✅ checkmarks]

## Integration Status
### Working Components ✅
[Components working with performance metrics]

### Pending Integration
[What's left for later days]

## BR Progress Tracking
[Table showing all BRs with completion status]

## Blockers
**None at this time** ✅ [or specific issues]

## Next Steps (Days X+1 to N)
[Detailed plan for remaining days]

## Confidence Assessment
**Current Confidence**: Z%
[Detailed justification with risks/assumptions]

## Team Handoff Notes
[Key files, running locally, debugging tips]
```

**Total per EOD**: ~400 lines × 2 docs = ~800 lines per service

---

### 4. Error Handling Philosophy Structure
```markdown
# Error Handling Philosophy - [Service Name]

## Executive Summary
[3-4 sentences on retry vs fail strategy]

## Error Classification Taxonomy

### 1. Transient Errors (RETRY)
[Table with 5-8 retryable error types]

### 2. Permanent Errors (FAIL IMMEDIATELY)
[Table with 5-8 permanent error types]

### 3. [Service-Specific] Errors
[Table with domain-specific errors]

## Retry Policy Defaults
[Configuration with backoff progression table]

## Operational Guidelines
[Monitoring metrics, alert thresholds]

## Testing Strategy
[Unit, integration, chaos engineering]

## Summary
[5-7 key principles]
```

**Total**: ~300 lines per service

---

### 5. BR Coverage Matrix Enhancement
```markdown
## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
[Table showing Envtest for integration per ADR-016]

## 🔬 Edge Case Coverage - X Additional Test Scenarios
[Table showing explicit edge case BRs]

## 📝 Test Implementation Guidance
[Complete DescribeTable example with 10+ entries]

## 📊 Coverage Summary (Defense-in-Depth Strategy)
[Table showing overlapping coverage summing to 130-180%]
- Unit: 70-85% (target: 70%+)
- Integration: 50-75% (target: >50%)
- E2E: 10-25% (target: 10-15%)
- Total: 130-180% ✅ (overlapping)
```

**Total enhancement**: ~200 lines per service

---

## Implementation Order (If Approved)

### Option A: Sequential (Safest)
1. **Week 1**: Remediation Processor (12-15h)
2. **Week 2**: Workflow Execution (10-13h)
3. **Week 3**: Kubernetes Executor (14-17h)

**Total**: 3 weeks

### Option B: Parallel by Phase (Faster)
1. **Week 1**: All Day 2 expansions (3 × 3h = 9h)
2. **Week 1**: All Day 4 expansions (3 × 3h = 9h)
3. **Week 2**: All Day 7 expansions (3 × 3h = 9h)
4. **Week 2**: All integration tests (3 × 4.5h = 13.5h)
5. **Week 3**: All documentation (3 × 3.5h = 10.5h)

**Total**: 2.5 weeks (faster but more context switching)

## Approval Questions

Please review and answer:

1. **Structure**: Is the APDC day expansion structure appropriate?
   - Analysis → Plan → DO-RED → DO-GREEN → DO-REFACTOR
   - ~900 lines per critical day

2. **Testing**: Is the integration test approach correct?
   - Envtest for CRD controllers per ADR-016
   - 3 tests per service (~200 lines each)
   - Defense-in-depth coverage (overlapping >130%)

3. **Documentation**: Is the EOD/Error Philosophy format sufficient?
   - 2-3 EOD checkpoints per service (~400 lines each)
   - 1 error philosophy per service (~300 lines)

4. **Go Code Standards**: ✅ Confirmed - All code will include complete imports
   - Package declarations, full import blocks, helper functions
   - See GO_CODE_STANDARDS_FOR_PLANS.md for details
   - Current plans show structure; implementation adds imports

5. **Scope**: Should all 3 services be expanded, or prioritize differently?
   - Current plan: All 3 to 95% confidence
   - Alternative: Focus on 1-2 services first?

6. **Timeline**: Sequential (3 weeks) or parallel by phase (2.5 weeks)?

7. **Any concerns** with the approach or estimated effort?

---

## Next Steps (After Approval)

1. Confirm approval to proceed
2. Confirm implementation order (sequential vs parallel)
3. Begin with first service's Day 2 expansion
4. Update TODOs as each phase completes
5. Provide progress updates at each EOD milestone
