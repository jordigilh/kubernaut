# Graceful Restart Workflow Schema - Job Backend (BR-WORKFLOW-004)
# Scenario: #129 -- Predictive memory exhaustion -> graceful restart
metadata:
  workflowId: graceful-restart-v1
  version: "1.0.0"
  description:
    what: "Performs a graceful rolling restart of a deployment to reset its runtime state and reclaim leaked memory"
    whenToUse: "When predictive analysis indicates a container is trending toward OOM based on memory growth rate, and a restart will reset the leak without data loss"
    whenNotToUse: "When the memory growth is from legitimate workload (cache warming, data loading) rather than a leak, or when the application cannot tolerate restarts"
    preconditions: "The deployment supports rolling restarts without data loss, and the memory growth pattern is confirmed as a leak (linear, unbounded)"
