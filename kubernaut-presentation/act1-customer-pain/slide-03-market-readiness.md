## 💬 Customer Pain Quotes (Synthesized from Research)

### Quote 1: Observability Isn't Enough
> *"We tried Datadog, Dynatrace, and PagerDuty. **Great at observability, terrible at autonomous action.** We still wake up at 3 AM."*

### Quote 2: GitOps Has Limits
> *"GitOps is great for deployments, but what about runtime operational incidents? **That's where we're bleeding.**"*

### Quote 3: Engineering Burnout
> *"We spend more time firefighting than building features. We need AI that doesn't just tell us what's wrong — **it needs to fix it.**"*
