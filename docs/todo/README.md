## 🛠️ **DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **TDD Approach (Mandatory)**
Each document provides comprehensive **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** plans:
- **RED Phase**: Write failing tests first (30-45 minutes)
- **GREEN Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests (1-3 hours)
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Enhance and optimize (30-45 minutes)

### **Architecture Compliance**
All services follow the approved architecture:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Port Standardization**: Fixed ports per approved specification
- **Image Naming**: `quay.io/jordigilh/{service-name}` format
- **Health Endpoints**: Standardized `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints

### **Business Requirements Mapping**
Every service maps to specific business requirements:
- **Gateway**: BR-WH-001 to BR-WH-015 (Webhook handling)
- **AI Analysis**: BR-AI-001 to BR-AI-140 (AI analysis and decision making)
- **Workflow**: BR-WF-001 to BR-WF-165 (Workflow execution)
- **Executor**: BR-EX-001 to BR-EX-155 (Kubernetes operations)
- **Storage**: BR-STOR-001 to BR-STOR-135 (Data persistence)
- **Context**: BR-CTX-001 to BR-CTX-180 (Context orchestration)
- **Notifications**: BR-NOTIF-001 to BR-NOTIF-120 (Multi-channel notifications)

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Common Patterns Across All Services**
1. **HTTP Service Wrapper**: Create `cmd/{service-name}/main.go` with HTTP server
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with defaults
3. **Health Monitoring**: `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling and resource cleanup
5. **Structured Logging**: JSON logging with configurable levels
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and logging

### **Reusable Components**
- **Configuration Patterns**: `internal/config/` - Standard configuration loading
- **Logging Setup**: Structured JSON logging with logrus
- **HTTP Server Setup**: Standard patterns with timeouts and middleware
- **Health Checks**: Standardized health check implementations
- **Metrics Integration**: Prometheus metrics collection

### **Testing Strategy**

- **COORDINATION**: Use document-based coordination rather than shared code

### **4. TDD Methodology**
- **DO**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle as documented
