Incident Analysis FastAPI Endpoint

Business Requirement: BR-HAPI-002 (Incident Analysis Endpoint)

This module defines the FastAPI router and endpoint for incident analysis.
It handles HTTP request/response and delegates business logic to llm_integration module.

    Called by: AIAnalysis Controller (for initial incident RCA and workflow selection)

    Flow:
    1. Receive IncidentRequest from AIAnalysis
    2. Sanitize input for LLM (BR-HAPI-211)
    3. Call HolmesGPT SDK for investigation (BR-HAPI-002)
    4. Search workflow catalog via MCP (BR-HAPI-250)
    5. Validate workflow response (DD-HAPI-002 v1.2)
    6. Self-correct if validation fails (up to 3 attempts)
    7. Emit audit event with complete response (DD-AUDIT-005)
    8. Return IncidentResponse with RCA and workflow selection
