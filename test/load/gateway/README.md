# Load Testing Tier - Gateway

**Purpose**: Test Gateway under heavy load and high concurrency  
**Coverage Target**: <5% of total tests  
**Infrastructure**: Dedicated test environment, performance monitoring

---

## ⚡ **Tests to Implement** (1 test)

### **High Concurrency Tests** (1 test)

1. **High Concurrency Storm Detection** (`storm_high_concurrency_test.go`)
   - Send 100+ concurrent alerts simultaneously
   - Verify storm detection threshold works (10 alerts)
   - Verify storm CRD created
   - Verify subsequent alerts aggregated
   - Verify no race conditions
   - Verify storm counters accurate
   
   **Business Value**: Validates storm detection under production load
   **Priority**: MEDIUM - Important for production scale
   **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

---

## 🛠️ **Infrastructure Requirements**

### **Load Testing**:
- High concurrency test framework (already exists in `test/load/`)
- Performance monitoring (response times, throughput)
- Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, Redis, K8s API)
- Dedicated test environment (not local Kind cluster)

### **Metrics**:
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Resource utilization

## 📊 **Estimated Effort**

- **Load Test Implementation**: 4-6 hours
- **Infrastructure**: Already exists in `test/load/`
- **Total**: 4-6 hours

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- Storm detection works correctly under 100+ concurrent requests
- No race conditions or data corruption
- Performance metrics within acceptable limits
- Clear documentation for load scenarios

**Status**: 📋 **PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**  
**Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Important for production scale  
**Next Step**: Implement high concurrency storm detection test
