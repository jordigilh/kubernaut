**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: Business Requirements Specification
**Module**: AI Context Orchestration (`pkg/ai/holmesgpt/`, `pkg/api/context/`)

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Business Purpose
The AI Context Orchestration components provide **historical and organizational intelligence** for AI-driven investigations. This capability complements HolmesGPT's real-time data gathering toolsets by providing historical patterns, organizational context, and trend analysis that guide investigation strategy and decision-making.

**Critical Architectural Distinction**:
- **HolmesGPT Toolsets** (kubernetes, prometheus): Real-time operational data (current logs, events, metrics)
- **Context API Service**: Historical intelligence and organizational context (NOT current/real-time data)

This separation enables efficient dual-source intelligence gathering: HolmesGPT answers "What's happening NOW?" while Context API answers "What happened BEFORE?" and "What's the organizational context?"

### 1.2 Scope
- **Dynamic Context Orchestration**: AI-driven context data retrieval based on investigation needs
- **Context API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for real-time context access
- **HolmesGPT Toolset Integration**: Custom toolsets enabling HolmesGPT to orchestrate context gathering
- **Dynamic Toolset Configuration**: Automatic toolset configuration based on deployed cluster services
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced payload sizes and improved investigation efficiency
- **Architectural Evolution**: Migration from static pre-enrichment to dynamic orchestration

### 1.3 Business Value
- **40-60% improvement** in investigation efficiency through targeted context gathering
- **50-70% reduction** in network payload sizes and memory utilization
- **15-25% improvement** in context relevance and investigation accuracy
- **Zero-configuration adaptability** to cluster environments through dynamic service discovery
- **30-50% reduction** in setup complexity through automatic toolset configuration
- **Enhanced scalability** for complex investigation scenarios
- **Future-proof architecture** for AI-driven troubleshooting evolution

## 15. Architectural Clarification & Updates (January 2025)

### 15.1 Context API vs. HolmesGPT Toolsets - Clear Separation

**Architectural Update**: Following HolmesGPT integration architecture design, Context API role has been clarified to focus exclusively on historical and organizational intelligence, complementing (not duplicating) HolmesGPT's real-time data gathering capabilities.

### 15.2 Dual-Source Intelligence Gathering Model

| Data Source | Purpose | Answers | Data Examples | Technology |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **HolmesGPT Toolsets** | Real-time operational data | "What's happening NOW?" | Current pod logs, live CPU/memory metrics, current K8s events, kubectl describe output | HolmesGPT SDK (kubernetes, prometheus toolsets) |
| **Context API Service** | Historical & organizational intelligence | "What happened BEFORE?" + "What's the organizational context?" | Past remediation actions, historical metric trends, similar alert patterns, business priority, SLA requirements | PostgreSQL + PGVector |

### 15.3 Updated Business Requirement Interpretations

**Clarified Requirements**:
- **BR-CONTEXT-006**: "Kubernetes cluster context" = Historical cluster intelligence (NOT current logs/events)
- **BR-CONTEXT-008**: "Real-time metrics context" = Historical trends delivered in real-time (NOT current Prometheus scrapes)
- **BR-API-006**: Cluster context endpoint = Organizational metadata, past patterns
- **BR-API-007**: Performance metrics endpoint = Historical trends, anomaly detection (NOT current values)

**Unchanged Requirements** (already accurate):
- **BR-CONTEXT-007**: Historical action patterns ✅
- **BR-API-008**: Action history ✅
- **BR-API-009**: Pattern matching ✅

### 15.4 Data Source Clarification

**Context API Data Sources**:
- ✅ **Primary**: Data Storage Service (PostgreSQL for historical data, PGVector for similarity search)
- ❌ **NOT**: Direct Kubernetes API access (HolmesGPT kubernetes toolset handles this)
- ❌ **NOT**: Direct Prometheus queries (HolmesGPT prometheus toolset handles this)

**HolmesGPT Toolsets Data Sources**:
- ✅ **kubernetes toolset**: Direct Kubernetes API access (logs, events, describe)
- ✅ **prometheus toolset**: Direct Prometheus API access (current metrics)
- ✅ **grafana toolset**: Direct Grafana API access (dashboards)

### 15.5 Integration Pattern

**Investigation Flow**:
```
1. AIAnalysis Service → HolmesGPT API (investigation request)
2. HolmesGPT API → Context API (fetch historical intelligence)
   Returns: Action history, pattern analysis, organizational context, metric trends
3. HolmesGPT API → HolmesGPT SDK (investigation with toolsets)
   - kubernetes toolset: Fetches current logs, events, resource status
   - prometheus toolset: Queries current metrics
   - Combined with historical context from step 2
4. HolmesGPT API → AIAnalysis Service (investigation results)
   Returns: Comprehensive analysis (real-time data + historical intelligence)
```

### 15.6 Performance Impact

**Clarified Performance Benefits**:
- **40-60% investigation improvement**: From targeted historical context (not full database dumps)
- **50-70% payload reduction**: Compressed historical trends vs. raw time-series data
- **15-25% accuracy improvement**: Historical patterns guide investigation strategy

**Note**: HolmesGPT toolsets fetch real-time data directly (not through Context API), ensuring fresh operational data.

### 15.7 Migration Impact

**No Breaking Changes**: This is a clarification of existing architecture, not a change:
- Context API was always intended to provide historical intelligence
- HolmesGPT toolsets were always intended to fetch real-time data
- Original BR requirements used ambiguous language ("real-time metrics context") which has now been clarified

**Updated Documents**:
- ✅ `10_AI_CONTEXT_ORCHESTRATION.md` (this document) - BR-CONTEXT-006, BR-CONTEXT-008, BR-API-006, BR-API-007 clarified
- ✅ `08-holmesgpt-api.md` (stateless service spec) - Already reflects correct architecture
- ✅ `REMAINING_SERVICES_PLAN.md` (service planning) - Context API description updated
