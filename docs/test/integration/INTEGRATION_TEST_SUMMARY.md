## 🎯 **Integration Test Plan Overview**

### **What We've Created**
A comprehensive integration test plan that validates **Milestone 1 production readiness** through systematic testing of core business requirements against a real Kubernetes environment.

### **Hybrid Performance Testing Strategy** ✅
**Phase A: Business Requirement Validation** (3-4 hours)
- Validate exact compliance with documented requirements
- Pass/fail criteria against specific business thresholds
- Critical for Milestone 1 completion

**Phase B: Capacity Exploration** (4-5 hours)
- Understand system performance characteristics
- Find operational limits and breaking points
- Inform capacity planning and scaling decisions
