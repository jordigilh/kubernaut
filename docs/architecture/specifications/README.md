## üéØ Purpose of Specifications

Specifications in this directory:
- ‚úÖ Define **authoritative schemas** used by multiple services
- ‚úÖ Document **cross-service contracts** and interfaces
- ‚úÖ Serve as **single source of truth** for shared data structures
- ‚úÖ Enable **consistent implementation** across service boundaries

## üìù Key Specifications

### **Notification Payload Schema**
**File**: `notification-payload-schema.md`
**Status**: ‚úÖ Authoritative Schema

Defines the unified notification payload structure used by all CRD controllers when sending escalation notifications to the Notification Service.

**Consumers**:
- Remediation Orchestrator (timeout escalations)
- AIAnalysis Controller (rejection escalations)
- WorkflowExecution Controller (failure escalations)
- RemediationProcessor (validation failure escalations)

**Provider**:
- Notification Service (`POST /api/v1/notify/escalation`)

### **BR Mapping Matrix**
**File**: `br-mapping-matrix.md`
**Status**: ‚úÖ Authoritative Reference

Comprehensive mapping of business requirements (BR-XXX-XXX format) across all services, showing which services implement which business requirements.

**Use Cases**:
- Verify BR coverage across services
- Track business requirement implementation
- Identify gaps in BR implementation
- Facilitate BR-driven development
