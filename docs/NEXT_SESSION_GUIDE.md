**Note**: Later renamed to "Remediation Request Controller" (see DONE-7)

---

### DONE-4: Type Safety Remediation (December 2024)

**Duration**: ~1 week
**Effort**: ~40 hours
**Outcome**: All `map[string]interface{}` violations fixed

#### DONE-4.1: Type Safety Audit
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/ALERT_PROCESSOR_TYPE_SAFETY_TRIAGE.md`

**Audit Findings**:
- ❌ 8 type safety violations in Alert Processor CRD
- ❌ 6 violations in AI Analysis CRD
- ❌ 5 violations in Workflow Execution CRD
- ❌ 3 violations in Kubernetes Executor CRD
- ❌ 4 violations in Central Controller CRD

**Total**: 26 type safety violations across 5 services

**Root Cause**: Initial designs used `map[string]interface{}` for flexibility, violating type safety rules

---

#### DONE-4.2: Type Safety Fixes Applied
**Documents Updated**: All 5 CRD service specifications

**Fix Pattern**:
```go
// ❌ BEFORE (Type Unsafe)
EnrichedAlert map[string]interface{} `json:"enrichedAlert"`

// ✅ AFTER (Type Safe)
EnrichedAlert EnrichedAlert `json:"enrichedAlert"`

type EnrichedAlert struct {
    Fingerprint      string `json:"fingerprint"`
    Severity         string `json:"severity"`
    Environment      string `json:"environment"`
    BusinessPriority int    `json:"businessPriority"`
    // ... structured fields
}
```

**Outcome**: All CRD schemas now use fully structured types with compile-time safety

**New Confidence**: 90-95% across all services

---

### DONE-5: Approval Workflow Enhancement (December 2024)

**Duration**: ~1 week
**Effort**: ~60 hours
**Outcome**: Rego-based approval policy system designed

#### DONE-5.1: Approval Mechanism Design
**Trigger**: User questioned manual approval scalability

**Initial Proposal**: Annotation-based approval (rejected by user)

**User Feedback**: "Propose alternative - how should manual approval happen?"

---

#### DONE-5.2: Rego Policy Solution
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/02-aianalysis/` (updated)

**Solution Designed**:
- ✅ `AIApprovalRequest` CRD (separate from AIAnalysis)
- ✅ Rego policy files in ConfigMaps
- ✅ Auto-approval based on action types + environment
- ✅ Manual approval via CR patching (setting `approved: true`)

**Rego Policy Example**:
```rego
package kubernaut.approval

allow {
    input.action == "scale_deployment"
    input.environment == "development"
    input.scaleDirection == "down"
}

allow {
    input.action == "restart_pod"
    input.environment != "production"
}
```

**Confidence Assessment**: 92% (Rego adds complexity but provides flexibility)

**User Decision**: Approved Rego approach

**Impact**:
- AI Analysis service specification updated with approval workflow
- Rego ConfigMap management added to deployment
- Later formalized in ADR-003 (pending)

---

### DONE-6: Testing Strategy Refinement (December 2024)

**Duration**: ~2 weeks
**Effort**: ~100 hours
**Outcome**: Testing strategy updated, test migration plan created

#### DONE-6.1: Testing Strategy Documentation
**Documents**: Per-service `testing-strategy.md` files in all 5 CRD services

**Added to Each Service**:
- ✅ APDC-TDD workflow (Analysis → Plan → DO-RED → DO-GREEN → DO-REFACTOR → Check)
- ✅ Unit test examples (Ginkgo/Gomega with fake K8s client)
- ✅ Integration test scenarios (real K8s with KIND)
- ✅ E2E test scenarios (complete workflows)
- ✅ Business requirement mapping (BR-xxx per test)

**Example Structure**:
```go
var _ = Describe("AlertProcessing Controller", func() {
    Context("when processing new alert (BR-ALERT-002)", func() {
        It("should enrich alert with environment classification", func() {
            // Test implementation
        })
    })
})
```

---

#### DONE-6.2: Integration Test Coverage Increase
**Document**: `.cursor/rules/03-testing-strategy.mdc` (updated)

**Change**:
- **Old**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E
- **New**: 70% unit, **>50% integration**, <10% E2E

**Rationale**: Microservices architecture requires more cross-service integration testing

**User Approval**: "Due to microservices nature, increase integration tests to >50%"

**Impact**: All service testing strategies now target >50% integration coverage

---

#### DONE-6.3: Test Migration Strategy
**Document**: `docs/todo/testing/TEST_MIGRATION_VS_REWRITE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Analysis**:
- Existing codebase has ~15,000 lines of tests
- ~60% can be migrated with minimal changes
- ~30% need architecture-based rewrites
- ~10% need complete redesign

**Effort Estimate**: 800 hours

**Approach**: Hybrid (migrate majority, rewrite architecture-impacted tests)

**Status**: Documented for implementation phase

---

### DONE-7: Architecture Rename (January 2025)

**Duration**: ~2 days
**Effort**: ~16 hours
**Outcome**: Consistent "Remediation" family naming

#### DONE-7.1: Naming Inconsistency Identified
**Trigger**: User question - "Why is it called AlertRemediation when we support Kubernetes Events too?"

**Analysis**:
- `AlertRemediation` implies Prometheus alerts only
- Kubernetes Events are NOT alerts
- Need more generic naming

---

#### DONE-7.2: Naming Options Analysis
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/stateless/SIGNAL_VS_REMEDIATION_NAMING_ANALYSIS.md`

**Options Evaluated**:
- **Option A**: "Signal" family (`SignalRemediation`, `Signal Processor`, `SignalProcessing`)
- **Option B**: "Remediation" family (`RemediationRequest`, `Remediation Processor`, `RemediationProcessing`)

**User Decision**: "Option B - Remediation family"

**Rationale**:
- Directly aligns with product's remediation focus
- "Signal" too generic (could mean anything)
- "Remediation" makes business purpose clear

---

#### DONE-7.3: Rename Execution
**Documents**:
- `docs/todo/services/ARCHITECTURE_RENAME_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/todo/services/ARCHITECTURE_RENAME_COMPLETE.md`

**Changes Applied** (69 files updated):

**CRD Names**:
- `AlertRemediation` → `RemediationRequest` (Central Controller CRD)
- `AlertProcessing` → `RemediationProcessing` (Child CRD)

**Service Names**:
- `Alert Processor` → `Remediation Processor`
- `Alert Remediation Controller` → `Remediation Request Controller`

**Directories**:
- `01-alertprocessor/` → `01-remediationprocessor/`

**API Groups**:
- `alertremediation.kubernaut.io/v1` → `remediation.kubernaut.io/v1`
- `alertprocessing.kubernaut.io/v1` → `remediationprocessing.kubernaut.io/v1`

**Go Packages**:
- `pkg/alertremediation/` → `pkg/remediation/`
- `pkg/alertprocessing/` → `pkg/remediationprocessing/`

**Files Updated**:
- All 5 CRD service specifications
- E2E test scenarios
- Business requirements documents
- Cross-references in all supporting docs

**Result**: Consistent naming across entire codebase

**Confidence**: 90%

---

### DONE-8: Central Controller Pattern Violations Fixed (January 2025)

**Duration**: ~1 day
**Effort**: ~8 hours
**Outcome**: RBAC violations fixed, architectural notes added

#### DONE-8.1: Violation Identified
**Trigger**: User observation - "Why are other controllers updating RemediationRequest.status fields?"

**Principle Violated**: Central Controller Pattern dictates that ONLY the central controller updates the parent CRD status

**User Statement**: "Those controllers are not supposed to know about the RemediationRequest CR instance as part of their reconciliation flow. It's the central controller who is responsible for updating the CRD instances, no one else."

---

#### DONE-8.2: Comprehensive Analysis
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/CENTRAL_CONTROLLER_VIOLATION_ANALYSIS.md`

**Pattern Defined**:
- ✅ Central Controller creates ALL child CRDs
- ✅ Central Controller watches ALL child CRD status updates
- ✅ Central Controller updates ONLY RemediationRequest.status
- ✅ Child controllers update ONLY their own CRD status
- ❌ Child controllers NEVER update RemediationRequest.status

**Violation Impact**:
- Race conditions (multiple writers to same status field)
- Inconsistent state (who owns the truth?)
- Debugging nightmares (which controller updated what?)

---

#### DONE-8.3: Audit Performed
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/CENTRAL_CONTROLLER_VIOLATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**Audit Scope**: All 4 child CRD controllers

**Code Audit Results**: ✅ No violations found in reconciliation logic

**RBAC Audit Results**: ❌ 2 violations found

**Violations**:
1. **Remediation Processor** (`01-remediationprocessor/controller-implementation.md:60`):
   ```yaml
   //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=kubernaut.io,resources=alertremediations/status,verbs=get;update;patch
   ```
   **Issue**: Has `update;patch` permissions (should only have `get`)

2. **Workflow Execution** (`03-workflowexecution/controller-implementation.md:64`):
   ```yaml
   //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=kubernaut.io,resources=alertremediations/status,verbs=get;update;patch
   ```
   **Issue**: Same over-permissive RBAC

---

#### DONE-8.4: Fixes Applied
**Documents**:
- `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/CENTRAL_CONTROLLER_VIOLATION_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `01-remediationprocessor/controller-implementation.md` (updated)
- `03-workflowexecution/controller-implementation.md` (updated)
- `01-remediationprocessor/security-configuration.md` (updated)
- `03-workflowexecution/security-configuration.md` (updated)

**Fix 1: RBAC Permissions Removed**
```diff
- //+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=kubernaut.io,resources=alertremediations/status,verbs=get;update;patch
+ // NOTE: NO status write permissions - Central Controller Pattern (see below)
```

**Fix 2: Architectural Notes Added**
Both controller implementation files now include:
```markdown
## Central Controller Pattern - Architectural Note

This controller follows the **Central Controller Pattern**:
- ✅ Updates ONLY `RemediationProcessing.status` (its own CRD)
- ❌ NEVER updates `RemediationRequest.status` (parent CRD)
- 🔄 Remediation Request Controller watches this CRD and aggregates status

**Why No Write Permissions?**
- Single writer per status field (prevents race conditions)
- Clear ownership (RemediationRequest Controller owns parent status)
- Watch-based coordination (child updates trigger parent reconciliation)
```

**Fix 3: Security Configuration Updated**
Both security configuration files now include:
```markdown
## Central Controller Pattern - RBAC Justification

**Principle**: Child controllers should NOT have write permissions on parent CRD status.

**RBAC for RemediationRequest**:
- ✅ `get` - Read parent CRD to check references
- ❌ `update` - NO write permissions (Central Controller owns this)
- ❌ `patch` - NO write permissions (Central Controller owns this)
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Confirmed no remaining violations
grep -r "alertremediations/status.*update\|patch" \
  docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/ \
  --include="*.md" | \
  grep -v "05-centralcontroller\|archive\|AUDIT\|ANALYSIS"
# Result: 0 matches
```

**Result**: All child controllers now follow Central Controller Pattern correctly

**Confidence**: 100%

---

### DONE-9: Notification Service Specification (December 2024)

**Duration**: ~2 weeks
**Effort**: ~80 hours
**Outcome**: Complete notification service specification with multi-channel support

#### DONE-9.1: Initial Design
**Trigger**: Central Controller and Workflow Execution need escalation notifications

**Requirements Identified**:
- Multi-channel support (Slack, Email, PagerDuty, Webhook)
- Severity-based routing
- Comprehensive escalation context
- Secret management
- Rate limiting

---

#### DONE-9.2: Critical Issues Triage & Solutions
**Documents**:
- `docs/todo/services/stateless/NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_TRIAGE.md`
- `docs/todo/services/stateless/NOTIFICATION_CRITICAL_ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md`

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **RBAC Filtering**: Should notifications filter by RBAC permissions?
   - **Decision**: NO - Provide links to external services (they handle auth)
   - **Rationale**: Notifications are advisory, not access control

2. **Error Handling**: What happens if notification fails?
   - **Solution**: Retry with fallback to secondary channel, log for audit

3. **Secret Management**: How to securely handle API keys?
   - **Solution V1**: Projected Volume + ServiceAccount Token
   - **Solution Prod**: External Secrets Operator + Vault

4. **Channel Adapter Robustness**: What if adapter fails?
   - **Solution**: Circuit breaker pattern, health checks, fallback channels

5. **OAuth2 Authentication**: How to authenticate API requests?
   - **Solution**: JWT from Kubernetes OAuth2 server + TokenReviewer

---

#### DONE-9.3: Complete Specification
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/stateless/notification-service/`

**Features Documented**:
- ✅ Multi-channel notification (Slack, Email, PagerDuty, Webhook)
- ✅ Channel adapter pattern with priority/severity-based routing
- ✅ Escalation notifications with comprehensive context (alert, resources, root cause, recommendations)
- ✅ EphemeralNotifier for testing (in-memory + optional file)
- ✅ Credential scanning and sanitization (regex patterns for secrets)
- ✅ Rate limiting (per-recipient token bucket)
- ✅ Notification deduplication (fingerprint-based with TTL)
- ✅ Template management (ConfigMaps + Go templates)
- ✅ Observability (structured logging, distributed tracing, metrics)

**Business Requirements**: BR-NOT-001 through BR-NOT-037

**Confidence**: 92%

---

### DONE-10: E2E Test Scenarios Definition (December 2024 - January 2025)

**Duration**: ~2 weeks
**Effort**: ~60 hours
**Outcome**: Comprehensive E2E test scenarios with GitOps integration

#### DONE-10.1: Initial E2E Scenarios
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/E2E_TEST_SCENARIOS_PROPOSAL.md`

**Scenarios Proposed**:
1. Pod OOMKilled → Memory increase
2. High CPU throttling → CPU limit adjustment
3. Deployment rollout stuck → Force restart
4. PVC storage near full → Volume expansion
5. Service endpoint unavailable → Restart pods
6. ConfigMap mismatch → Update ConfigMap

**User Feedback on Scenario 6**: "ConfigMap modification is not GitOps valid. Configuration objects cannot be modified as remediation, only escalation is possible due to GitOps such as ArgoCD reconciling the value upon modification."

---

#### DONE-10.2: GitOps Integration Analysis
**Trigger**: User identified GitOps constraint (ArgoCD prevents direct config modification)

**Problem**: How to handle remediations in GitOps-operated clusters?

**Analysis**:
- **Imperative Operations**: Direct K8s patches (pods, deployments) - OK
- **Declarative Operations**: Config changes (ConfigMaps, Secrets) - NOT OK (GitOps owns)

---

#### DONE-10.3: GitOps Remediation Strategy
**Documents**:
- `docs/requirements/07_GITOPS_INTEGRATION.md` (BR-GITOPS-001 through BR-GITOPS-014)
- `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/E2E_GITOPS_STRATEGY_FINAL.md`

**Strategy Defined**:
1. **Detect GitOps**: Check for ArgoCD/Flux annotations on resources
2. **If GitOps Present**: Create PR in Git repository (Plain YAML + GitHub for MVP)
3. **If No GitOps**: Direct patch (with Rego policy approval)
4. **If Direct Patch Blocked**: Escalate via Notification Service

**Priority Order**:
1. **Notification** (manual) - Highest priority when GitOps prevents automation
2. **GitOps PR** (reviewed) - For declarative config changes
3. **Direct Patch** (automated) - For dev environments with auto-approval

**Safeguards**:
- ArgoCD/Flux annotation detection (code-level, not configurable)
- Rego policy evaluation (auto-approval rules per environment)
- Credential scanning (prevent exposing secrets in PRs)

**Git Libraries Selected**:
- `go-git/go-git` - Git operations (clone, commit, push)
- `google/go-github/v57` - GitHub API (PR creation)
- `xanzy/go-gitlab` - GitLab API (Phase 2)

**Confidence**: 88%

---

#### DONE-10.4: OOM Pattern Analysis
**Trigger**: User questioned single OOM remediation - "Only increase memory if OOMs are repeating over a short period"

**New Requirement**: BR-AI-037 (OOM pattern analysis before resource increases)

**Scenario 1 Refined** (Pod OOMKilled):
- **Scenario 1a**: Single OOM → Monitor (no action)
- **Scenario 1b**: Repeated OOMs (3+ in 15 min) → Increase memory + Create GitOps PR
- **Scenario 1c**: Memory leak pattern → Escalate (needs code fix, not resource increase)

**Impact**: AI Analysis service must perform pattern analysis before recommending resource increases

---

### DONE-11: Documentation Restructuring (December 2024)

**Duration**: ~1 week
**Effort**: ~40 hours
**Outcome**: Service documentation split into modular subdocuments

#### DONE-11.1: Monolithic Document Problem
**Issue**: Single 3,000+ line documents are hard to navigate and maintain

**Example**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/01-alert-processor.md` (3,040 lines)

---

#### DONE-11.2: Directory Structure Pilot
**Document**: `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/01-remediationprocessor/` (new structure)

**Structure Created**:
```
01-remediationprocessor/
├── README.md                     # Service overview (300 lines)
├── overview.md                   # Architecture + diagrams (400 lines)
├── controller-implementation.md  # Reconciliation logic (600 lines)
├── crd-schema.md                 # Type definitions (400 lines)
├── database-integration.md       # Audit persistence (300 lines)
├── finalizers-lifecycle.md       # Cleanup logic (400 lines)
├── integration-points.md         # Dependencies (300 lines)
├── metrics-slos.md               # Prometheus metrics (400 lines)

├── security-configuration.md     # RBAC, policies (500 lines)
└── testing-strategy.md           # APDC-TDD tests (600 lines)
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier navigation (specific topics)
- Parallel editing (multiple team members)
- Reusable sections (security patterns across services)

  - Current metrics (PromQL queries)
  - Recent events (kubectl events)
  - Resource state (kubectl describe)

**Dual-Source Intelligence Model**:
```
AIAnalysis Investigation
├── Context API → Historical patterns (stored)
└── HolmesGPT Toolsets → Real-time data (fetched)
```

**Result**: No overlap, complementary services

---

#### DONE-13.3: Business Requirements Updated

**Changes Applied**:
- `AlertRemediation` → `RemediationRequest` (Central Controller CRD)
- `Alert Processor` → `Remediation Processor` (Service name)
- `AlertProcessing` → `RemediationProcessing` (Child CRD)
- `01-alertprocessor/` → `01-remediationprocessor/` (Directory)
- API groups updated to match new naming

**Rationale**: Support for both Prometheus Alerts AND Kubernetes Events required more generic naming

**Files Updated**: ~69 files across 5 CRD services + cross-references

---

#### 2.2: Central Controller Pattern Violations (✅ COMPLETE)
**Documents**:
- `docs/todo/services/crd-controllers/CENTRAL_CONTROLLER_VIOLATION_ANALYSIS.md`

**Achievement**: 11 of 11 services (100%) fully documented with ~131 active documentation files

---

### Priority 1: Complete Remaining ADRs (OPTIONAL - ~24 hours)

These ADRs would formalize existing architectural decisions that are already documented in service specifications. **Implementation can proceed without them**, but they provide valuable historical context.

#### Task 1.1: ADR-002 - Native Kubernetes Jobs
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
**Priority**: P3 - LOW (decision already documented in service specs)
**Status**: Design complete, ADR would formalize rationale

**Existing Documentation**:
- ✅ Complete design: `docs/services/crd-controllers/04-kubernetesexecutor/`
- ✅ Decision rationale documented in service `controller-implementation.md`

**ADR Would Document**:
- **Decision**: Use native K8s Jobs for remediation step execution
- **Alternatives**: Argo CD, Tekton, Custom Pods
- **Consequences**: Resource isolation, per-action RBAC, no extra dependencies
- **Template**: Use `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-001-crd-microservices-architecture.md` as reference

---

#### Task 1.2: ADR-004 - Fake Kubernetes Client for Testing
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
**Priority**: P3 - LOW (decision already documented in testing strategies)
**Status**: Pattern used across all 5 CRD services, ADR would formalize

**Existing Documentation**:
- ✅ Pattern used in all service `testing-strategy.md` files
- ✅ Rationale: Fast, no infrastructure, full CRD support

**ADR Would Document**:
- **Decision**: Use `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client/fake` for unit tests
- **Alternatives**: Custom mocks, Real KIND cluster, TestEnv
- **Consequences**: Fast tests, in-memory, official tooling

---

#### Task 1.3: ADR-005 - >50% Integration Test Coverage
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
**Priority**: P3 - LOW (already implemented in testing rule)
**Status**: Rule updated, ADR would document rationale

**Existing Documentation**:
- ✅ Rule: `.cursor/rules/03-testing-strategy.mdc` (updated with >50% integration coverage)
- ✅ Applied to all 11 service testing strategies

**ADR Would Document**:
- **Decision**: Increase integration test coverage to >50% for microservices
- **Alternatives**: 20% integration (original), 30% integration, E2E only
- **Consequences**: Better cross-service validation, defense-in-depth strategy
