## 🚀 How to Use This System

### For New Service Implementation

#### Step 1: Copy the Template
```bash
cp docs/services/SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md \
   docs/services/[stateless|crd-controllers]/[service-name]/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

#### Step 2: Customize the Plan
Replace placeholders with service-specific details:
- `[Service Name]` → Your service name
- `[X]` days → Your estimated timeline
- `[Component list]` → Your components
- `[BR-CATEGORY-XXX]` → Your business requirements

#### Step 3: Add Service-Specific Details

**Required Customizations**:
1. **Components** (Days 2-6):
   - List your specific components
   - Map to business requirements
   - Define interfaces

2. **Performance Targets**:
   - Define your latency targets
   - Define your throughput targets
   - Define resource limits

3. **Integration Tests** (Day 8):
   - Define your 5 critical tests
   - Map to your core workflows

4. **BR Coverage** (Day 9):
   - List all your business requirements
   - Map to test types

#### Step 4: Create Implementation Structure
```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p docs/services/[type]/[service]/implementation/{phase0,testing,design}

# Copy enhanced plan as reference
cp docs/services/stateless/dynamic-toolset/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_ENHANCED.md \
   docs/services/[type]/[service]/implementation/REFERENCE_PLAN.md
```

## ✅ Critical Checkpoints (Apply to ALL Services)

### Checkpoint 1: Integration-First Testing (Day 8 Morning)
**Why**: Catches architectural issues 2 days earlier
**Action**: Write 5 integration tests before unit tests
**Evidence**: Gateway caught function signature mismatches early

**Template Test Structure**:
1. Basic flow (input → processing → output)
2. Deduplication/caching (if applicable)
3. Error recovery
4. State persistence
5. Authentication/authorization

### Checkpoint 2: Schema Validation (Day 7 EOD)
**Why**: Prevents test failures from schema mismatches
**Action**: Validate 100% field alignment before testing
**Evidence**: Gateway added missing CRD fields, avoided test failures

**Create File**: `implementation/design/01-[schema]-validation.md`

### Checkpoint 3: BR Coverage Matrix (Day 9 EOD)
**Why**: Ensures all requirements have test coverage
**Action**: Map every BR to tests, justify any skipped
**Evidence**: Gateway achieved 100% BR coverage

**Create File**: `implementation/testing/BR-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`

### Checkpoint 4: Production Readiness (Day 12)
**Why**: Reduces production deployment issues
**Action**: Complete comprehensive readiness checklist
**Evidence**: Gateway deployment went smoothly

**Create File**: `implementation/PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`

### Checkpoint 5: Daily Status Docs (Days 1, 4, 7, 12)
**Why**: Better progress tracking and handoffs
**Action**: Create progress documentation at key milestones
**Evidence**: Gateway handoff was smooth

**Create Files**:
- `phase0/01-day1-complete.md`
- `phase0/02-day4-midpoint.md`
- `phase0/03-day7-complete.md`
- `00-HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md`

## 🎓 Best Practices from Gateway + Dynamic Toolset

### Testing
1. ✅ **Integration-first**: Write 5 integration tests Day 8 Morning
2. ✅ **BR mapping**: Reference BR-XXX-XXX in every test
3. ✅ **BDD style**: Use Ginkgo/Gomega Describe/Context/It
4. ✅ **Real dependencies**: Use envtest, not mocks for integration

### Documentation
1. ✅ **Daily progress**: Status docs at Days 1, 4, 7, 12
2. ✅ **Design decisions**: DD-XXX entries for significant choices
3. ✅ **Troubleshooting**: Common issues with symptoms/diagnosis/resolution
4. ✅ **Handoff summary**: Executive summary at end

### Implementation
1. ✅ **APDC-TDD**: Follow ANALYSIS → PLAN → DO-RED → DO-GREEN → DO-REFACTOR → CHECK
2. ✅ **DO-REFACTOR**: Extract common patterns (don't skip this!)
3. ✅ **Error philosophy**: Define graceful degradation strategy
4. ✅ **Metrics**: 10+ Prometheus metrics minimum

### Production Readiness
1. ✅ **6 deliverables**: Readiness report, file org, performance, troubleshooting, confidence, handoff
2. ✅ **RBAC**: Minimal permissions only
3. ✅ **Resources**: Set requests and limits
4. ✅ **Observability**: Metrics + structured logging + correlation IDs

### Q: What if my service is simpler/smaller?
**A**: Use the template structure but compress timelines. The checkpoints still apply.

### Q: What if my service is more complex?
**A**: Extend Days 2-6 as needed. Keep the checkpoint structure (Days 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12).

### Q: Can I skip integration-first testing?
**A**: No. This is a critical checkpoint. Gateway evidence shows it saves 2+ days.

### Q: What if I find gaps in the template?
**A**: Document them in a triage doc and propose template updates!
