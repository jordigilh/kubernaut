## 🛠️ **Implementation Guide**

### Step 1: Execute Migration Script

```bash
# Review the migration plan
cat NEW_INTEGRATION_TEST_STRUCTURE.md

# Execute the full restructure migration
./migrate_integration_tests.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- Backup created at `test/integration_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- New structure at `test/integration_new`
- Migration log with detailed progress
- Validation summary with file counts

### Step 2: Update Build Configuration

```bash
# Apply Makefile updates
patch Makefile < makefile_integration_updates.patch

# Or manually add the new test targets
cat makefile_integration_updates.patch >> Makefile
```

### Step 3: Validate New Structure

```bash
# Test compilation
cd test/integration_new
go test -tags=integration -list=. ./...

# Test business domain execution
make test-ai-capabilities
make test-workflow-automation
make test-critical-business
```

### Step 4: Replace Old Structure

```bash
# Once validated, replace the old structure
mv test/integration test/integration_old
mv test/integration_new test/integration

# Update any remaining references
grep -r "test/integration" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json"
```
