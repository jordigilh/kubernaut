# APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md - Triage Report

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Document Triaged**: APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md (Version 2.2)
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES FOUND**
**Confidence**: 99%

---

## 🚨 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md document is **incomplete**. It lists **11 HTTP API services** but **completely omits the 5 CRD controllers** that are critical to Kubernaut's operation.

**Impact**: **HIGH** - New developers and architects reviewing this document will have an incomplete understanding of the system architecture.

---

## 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **CRITICAL-1: Missing 5 CRD Controllers**

**Issue**: The architecture document lists 11 V1 services, but these are only HTTP API services. It does NOT include the 5 Kubernetes CRD controllers.

**Evidence**:

**What's Listed** (11 HTTP API Services):
1. Gateway Service (Port 8080)
2. Remediation Processor Service (Port 8081)
3. AI Analysis Service (Port 8082)
4. Workflow Execution Service (Port 8083)
5. K8s Executor Service (Port 8084)
6. Data Storage Service (Port 8085)
7. Intelligence Service (Port 8086) - V2
8. Effectiveness Monitor Service (Port 8087)
9. HolmesGPT API Service (Port 8090)
10. Context API Service (Port 8091)
11. Notifications Service (Port 8089)

**What's MISSING** (5 CRD Controllers):
1. ✅ **Remediation Processor Controller** (Reconciles `RemediationRequest` CRDs)
2. ✅ **AI Analysis Controller** (Reconciles `AIAnalysis` CRDs)
3. ✅ **Workflow Execution Controller** (Reconciles `WorkflowExecution` CRDs)
4. ✅ **Kubernetes Executor Controller** (Reconciles `KubernetesExecution` CRDs)
5. ✅ **Remediation Orchestrator Controller** (Reconciles `RemediationRequest` CRDs) ← **User's Example**

**Documentation Exists**: All 5 controllers have complete documentation in `docs/services/crd-controllers/`

**Impact**:
- **Architecture Incompleteness**: Document shows only 11/16 components (69% coverage)
- **Developer Confusion**: New team members won't understand CRD reconciliation architecture
- **Design Gaps**: HTTP services reference CRDs but CRD controllers aren't documented
- **Implementation Ambiguity**: Unclear how CRD controllers fit into service deployment

---

### **CRITICAL-2: Inconsistent Service Count**

**Issue**: Document claims "11 V1 services" but actual V1 implementation has **16 components** (11 HTTP services + 5 CRD controllers).

**Evidence**:

Document header says:
> "V1 Microservices (11 Services) with V2 Roadmap (15 Services)"

Reality:
- **11 HTTP API Services** (Gateway, Remediation Processor, etc.)
- **5 CRD Controllers** (Remediation Processor, AI Analysis, Workflow Execution, K8s Executor, Remediation Orchestrator)
- **Total V1 Components**: **16**

**Correct Statement Should Be**:
> "V1 Architecture (16 Components: 11 HTTP Services + 5 CRD Controllers) with V2 Roadmap (20 Components total)"

---

### **CRITICAL-3: Service Flow Diagram Missing CRD Controllers**

**Issue**: The mermaid diagram in lines 57-202 shows HTTP service flow but omits CRD controller reconciliation loops.

**What's Shown**:
```
Prometheus → Gateway → Remediation Processor → AI Analysis → ... → K8s Executor
```

**What's MISSING**:
```
Gateway → [Creates RemediationRequest CRD]
          ↓
       Remediation Processor Controller (reconciles CRD)
          ↓
       [Creates AIAnalysis CRD]
          ↓
       AI Analysis Controller (reconciles CRD)
          ↓
       [Creates WorkflowExecution CRD]
          ↓
       Workflow Execution Controller (reconciles CRD)
          ↓
       [Creates KubernetesExecution CRD]
          ↓
       Kubernetes Executor Controller (reconciles CRD)
          ↓
       [Updates RemediationRequest CRD]
          ↓
       Remediation Orchestrator Controller (reconciles CRD)
```

**Impact**: Developers won't understand the CRD-based orchestration pattern that's central to Kubernaut's design.

---

### **CRITICAL-4: CRD References Without Controller Definitions**

**Issue**: Document mentions CRDs (lines 271, 434-435, 763-784) but never defines the controllers that reconcile them.

**Examples**:

**Line 271**:
> "All downstream services receive only non-duplicate alerts via **RemediationRequest CRDs**."

**Question**: Who creates RemediationRequest CRDs? **Answer (not in doc)**: Gateway Service
**Question**: Who reconciles RemediationRequest CRDs? **Answer (not in doc)**: Remediation Processor Controller

**Line 775**:
> "All service CRDs (**RemediationProcessing, AIAnalysis, WorkflowExecution, KubernetesExecution**) owned by RemediationRequest"

**Question**: Who reconciles these CRDs? **Answer (not in doc)**: The 4 CRD controllers

**Line 784**:
> "Design Reference: See [05-central-controller.md]..."

**Problem**: References "central-controller.md" which was renamed to "05-remediationorchestrator" but the controller is never listed as a service.

**Impact**: CRDs are mentioned but their lifecycle management (creation, reconciliation, deletion) is undefined.

---

## 🟠 **HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **HIGH-1: Obsolete Reference to "05-central-controller.md"**

**Issue**: Line 784 references `05-central-controller.md` but this was renamed to `05-remediationorchestrator`.

**Current (Incorrect)**:
```
Design Reference: See [05-central-controller.md](../services/crd-controllers/05-central-controller.md)
```

**Should Be**:
```
Design Reference: See [05-remediationorchestrator](../services/crd-controllers/05-remediationorchestrator/)
```

**Impact**: Broken documentation link, confusion about controller naming.

---

### **HIGH-2: Terminology Inconsistency (RemediationRequest vs RemediationRequest)**

**Issue**: Document uses both "RemediationRequest" and "RemediationRequest" for CRDs without clarification.

**Line 271**: "RemediationRequest CRDs"
**Line 768**: "RemediationRequest CRDs"
**Remediation Orchestrator**: Reconciles "RemediationRequest" CRD

**Question**: Are these the same CRD or different CRDs?

**Reality** (per CRD controller docs):
- **`RemediationRequest`**: Root CRD created by Gateway Service
- **`RemediationRequest`**: Child CRD (or different name?) reconciled by Remediation Orchestrator

**Impact**: Unclear CRD hierarchy and naming conventions.

---

### **HIGH-3: Port Assignments Missing for CRD Controllers**

**Issue**: HTTP services all have port assignments (8080-8094), but CRD controllers have no port documentation.

**Reality**: CRD controllers expose:
- **Metrics Port**: 9090 (Prometheus)
- **Health Probes**: 8081 (liveness/readiness) - per controller-runtime defaults

**Missing from Architecture Document**:
- Controller port assignments
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics exposure strategy

**Impact**: Deployment manifests may have port conflicts or incorrect health checks.

---

## 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **MEDIUM-1: Incomplete Service Connectivity Matrix**

**Issue**: Service Connectivity Matrix (lines 685-717) only shows HTTP service connections, not CRD-based connections.

**Missing Connections**:
```
Gateway Service → RemediationRequest CRD (creates)
Remediation Processor Controller → RemediationRequest CRD (reconciles)
Remediation Processor Controller → AIAnalysis CRD (creates)
AI Analysis Controller → AIAnalysis CRD (reconciles)
AI Analysis Controller → WorkflowExecution CRD (creates)
... etc.
```

**Impact**: Incomplete understanding of system data flows.

---

### **MEDIUM-2: Deployment Strategy Missing CRD Controllers**

**Issue**: Implementation Roadmap (lines 788-814) lists only HTTP services, not CRD controllers.

**Current Roadmap** (Phase 1, lines 790-801):
> "11. **Effectiveness Monitor Service** - Assessment and monitoring (graceful degradation)"

**Missing**:
> "12. Remediation Processor Controller - RemediationRequest CRD reconciliation"
> "13. AI Analysis Controller - AIAnalysis CRD reconciliation"
> "14. Workflow Execution Controller - WorkflowExecution CRD reconciliation"
> "15. Kubernetes Executor Controller - KubernetesExecution CRD reconciliation"
> "16. Remediation Orchestrator Controller - RemediationRequest CRD reconciliation"

**Impact**: Incomplete implementation plan, missing deployment order for controllers.

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S CORRECT IN THE DOCUMENT**

### **Strengths**:
1. ✅ CRD lifecycle management section is comprehensive (lines 763-784)
2. ✅ CRD retention policies well-documented
3. ✅ Owner references pattern documented
4. ✅ HTTP service specifications are complete and detailed
5. ✅ External integrations clearly defined
6. ✅ Security, monitoring, and operational excellence sections are thorough

## ✅ **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**

**Triage Confidence**: 99%

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ Verified 5 CRD controller directories exist in `docs/services/crd-controllers/`
2. ✅ Confirmed architecture document only lists 11 HTTP services
3. ✅ Verified CRD references in document without controller definitions
4. ✅ Confirmed obsolete "05-central-controller.md" reference
5. ✅ Verified Remediation Orchestrator exists but is not listed as a service

**Uncertainty (1%)**: Minor details about RemediationRequest vs RemediationRequest CRD naming

---

## 🎯 **BOTTOM LINE**

**The APPROVED_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md document is incomplete**. It documents 11 HTTP services but **completely omits the 5 CRD controllers** that form the backbone of Kubernaut's remediation orchestration.

**User's Example Confirmed**: Remediation Orchestrator Controller is indeed missing from the architecture document, along with 4 other CRD controllers.

**Action Required**: Add a comprehensive "CRD Controllers" section to the architecture document to provide complete system coverage.
