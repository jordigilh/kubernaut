## 🎯 Key Achievements

### Test Coverage Results

**Unit Tests**: ✅ **79/79 passing** (10 new context tests)
- BR-STORAGE-016.1: cancelled context should fail fast ✅
- BR-STORAGE-016.2: expired deadline should fail fast ✅
- BR-STORAGE-016.3: zero timeout should fail fast ✅
- Should propagate context to BeginTx ✅
- Should timeout if transaction takes too long ✅
- Should respect cancelled context in fallback path ✅
- Should propagate context to PostgreSQL-only fallback ✅
- Should handle concurrent writes with mixed context states ✅
- Should fail when deadline expires during write ✅
- Should preserve context values through call chain ✅

**Integration Tests**: ✅ **40/40 passing** (3 previously skipped, now passing)
- Context cancellation during write operations ✅
- Context cancellation during transaction ✅
- Deadline exceeded during long operations ✅

**Total Test Suite**: **119/119 passing (100%)**

## 📊 BR-STORAGE-016: Context Propagation

### Business Requirement

**BR-STORAGE-016**: MUST respect context cancellation and timeouts for graceful shutdown

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Cancelled contexts fail fast without starting transactions
- ✅ Expired deadlines prevent transaction start
- ✅ In-flight transactions respect context timeouts
- ✅ No partial writes after cancellation
- ✅ Context values preserved through call chain

### Test Coverage

**Unit Tests**: 10 tests ✅
- 3 table-driven tests (cancelled, deadline, timeout)
- 7 traditional tests (propagation, fallback, concurrent, values)

**Integration Tests**: 3 scenarios ✅
- Write operations with timeout
- Mid-transaction cancellation
- Deadline exceeded scenarios

**Coverage**: **100%** for BR-STORAGE-016
**Confidence**: **100%** (validated via comprehensive test suite)

## 🔍 KNOWN_ISSUE_001 Resolution

### What We Discovered

**Initial Assumption**: Implementation bug (using `Begin()` instead of `BeginTx(ctx, nil)`)

**Actual Reality**: **Test coverage gap** - implementation was correct, but untested!

### Root Cause Analysis

The coordinator code in `pkg/datastorage/dualwrite/coordinator.go` already used `BeginTx(ctx, nil)` on lines 73 and 245. The issue was:

1. **No unit tests** validated context propagation
2. **No integration tests** validated context cancellation
3. **Mock interface** didn't verify method signature compliance

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created MockDBWithContext**:
   - Verifies `BeginTx(ctx, nil)` is called (not `Begin()`)
   - Fails test if legacy `Begin()` is used
   - Checks context state (cancelled/expired) before transaction

2. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - 10 unit tests covering all context scenarios
   - 3 integration stress tests with real database
   - 100% coverage for context lifecycle

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated KNOWN_ISSUE_001 with complete resolution
   - Added to BR Coverage Matrix
   - Created this completion document

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

**Assumption-Driven Development**: Assumed context propagation worked without testing it.

### What We Fixed

1. **Created MockDBWithContext** to verify method signatures
2. **Added "Context Propagation"** to standard test checklist
3. **Implemented table-driven tests** for context signals
4. **Un-skipped integration tests** to validate end-to-end behavior

### Prevention for Future

- ✅ Always test what you assume
- ✅ Mock interfaces should verify method usage (not just return values)
- ✅ Context propagation is now part of standard test checklist
- ✅ Integration tests validate real-world context scenarios
