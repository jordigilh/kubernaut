# Model Comparison Analysis

**Analysis Date**: August 2025
**Status**: Framework Operational
**Test Infrastructure**: Ollama (Single Instance), ramallama (Multi-Instance)

## Overview

This document presents analysis of language model performance for Kubernetes alert remediation. Three models were evaluated against standardized alert scenarios measuring response time, decision accuracy, and consistency.

## Test Infrastructure

### Framework Components
- Ginkgo/Gomega test suite for automated model evaluation
- OpenAI-compatible API integration for consistent model interface
- Automated JSON response parsing and validation
- Performance metrics collection and reporting

### Infrastructure Configurations
- **Single Instance Mode**: Ollama with model switching (demo/development)
- **Multi-Instance Mode**: ramallama with parallel model serving (production)

## Evaluated Models

### granite3.1-dense:8b
- **Parameters**: 8 billion
- **Current Role**: Production baseline
- **Response Time Range**: 7-11 seconds
- **Decision Pattern**: Diverse action selection based on scenario type

### deepseek-coder:6.7b
- **Parameters**: 6.7 billion
- **Focus**: Code reasoning specialization
- **Response Time Range**: 7-25 seconds (highest variance)
- **Decision Pattern**: Conservative approach, bias toward resource scaling

### granite3.3:2b
- **Parameters**: 2 billion
- **Characteristics**: Compact model size
- **Response Time Range**: 3-19 seconds
- **Decision Pattern**: Rapid inference with mixed action diversity

## Test Methodology

### Scenario Coverage
Five alert scenarios per model representing common Kubernetes issues:
- Memory pressure and out-of-memory events
- CPU utilization requiring scaling decisions
- Storage management and disk space alerts
- Network connectivity issues
- General diagnostic collection needs

### Metrics Collection
- **Response Time**: Latency from prompt to parsed response
- **Decision Accuracy**: Percentage of responses matching expected actions
- **Alternative Match Rate**: Percentage of responses using acceptable alternative actions
- **Consistency**: Response stability across multiple runs
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed inference requests

## Results Summary

### Response Time Analysis
- granite3.3:2b: Lowest latency (3-19s range)
- granite3.1-dense:8b: Consistent performance (7-11s range)
- deepseek-coder:6.7b: Highest variance (7-25s range)

### Decision Accuracy Analysis
- granite3.1-dense:8b: 4/5 scenarios matched expected actions
- deepseek-coder:6.7b: Strong performance on memory scenarios, conservative on others
- granite3.3:2b: Rapid inference with mixed accuracy across scenarios

### Pattern Analysis
- **Resource Scaling Bias**: deepseek-coder:6.7b consistently selects resource increase actions
- **Action Diversity**: granite3.1-dense:8b demonstrates varied action selection based on scenario type
- **Speed-Accuracy Trade-off**: granite3.3:2b provides fastest responses with moderate accuracy

## Selection Criteria

### Low Latency Requirements
granite3.3:2b provides shortest response times with 2B parameter efficiency.

### Consistent Performance
granite3.1-dense:8b demonstrates stable response times and decision accuracy.

### Memory-Focused Scenarios
deepseek-coder:6.7b shows consistent resource scaling decisions for memory-related alerts.

## Framework Capabilities

### Operational Status
- Multi-model testing infrastructure functional
- Performance metric collection automated
- Report generation and analysis complete
- Alert scenario evaluation workflow validated

### Current Limitations
- Single instance mode: Model switching overhead in sequential execution
- Statistical sampling: Single execution per scenario insufficient for variance analysis
- Data aggregation: Results storage limited to final model's detailed metrics
- Scenario coverage: Subset of production alert scenarios

### Scaling Considerations
- Multi-instance infrastructure (ramallama) removes model switching overhead
- Expanded scenario coverage requires additional test development
- Statistical significance requires multiple runs per scenario
- Production evaluation requires real-world alert data

## Implementation Status

Framework validation demonstrates:
- Multi-model testing capability
- Performance benchmarking functionality
- Automated report generation
- Alert scenario evaluation processes

Framework operational for scaling with multi-instance infrastructure and expanded test scenarios.
