# HolmesGPT API Service - E2E/Testing Dependencies (Minimal)
#
# Strategy: Minimal dependencies for E2E testing with MOCK_LLM_MODE=true
# This file REMOVES cloud provider SDKs that aren't needed for mock LLM testing
#
# Size Impact: ~800MB (vs ~2.5GB with full requirements.txt)
# Build Time: 2-3 minutes (vs 5-15 minutes with full requirements.txt)
#
# Use Case: E2E tests, unit tests, integration tests with mock LLM mode
# NOT for production deployments (use requirements.txt for production)
#
# IMPORTANT: HolmesGPT has a dependency specification issue:
#   - Requires: supabase = "^2.5" (allows any 2.x)
#   - Requires: postgrest = "0.16.8" (locked for bug workaround)
#   - But supabase 2.9+ requires postgrest>=0.17 (conflict!)
#
# Solution: We constrain supabase to compatible version range.

# Constrain supabase to version compatible with HolmesGPT's postgrest pin
# Must install BEFORE HolmesGPT to prevent pip from picking incompatible version
# supabase 2.8+ requires postgrest>=0.17, but we need 0.16.8
# Also constrain httpx for supabase compatibility
supabase>=2.5,<2.8  # Compatible with postgrest 0.16.8 (HolmesGPT requirement)
postgrest==0.16.8   # Match HolmesGPT's pin exactly
httpx<0.28,>=0.24   # Supabase stack requires <0.28

# NOTE: urllib3 version is constrained by prometrix (from HolmesGPT SDK)
# prometrix 0.2.5 requires urllib3<2.0.0, so we cannot use urllib3 2.x
# OpenAPI clients must be compatible with urllib3 1.26.x
urllib3>=1.26.0,<2.0.0  # Required for prometrix compatibility

# HolmesGPT SDK (from local copy) - Install AFTER supabase constraint
# Using local copy from ../dependencies/holmesgpt/ for faster installation
../dependencies/holmesgpt/

# DataStorage OpenAPI Client (SOC2 audit events) - Required for audit emission
# Path relative to holmesgpt-api/ directory (works for both unit tests and Docker builds)
src/clients/datastorage/

# Additional service-specific dependencies (NOT in HolmesGPT SDK)
# These are only for holmesgpt-api service functionality

# Web framework dependencies (should come from HolmesGPT SDK but explicitly added for E2E)
fastapi>=0.116
uvicorn[standard]>=0.30

# HTTP client for K8s TokenReviewer API (not used by HolmesGPT SDK)
aiohttp>=3.9.1
aiodns>=3.1.1

# Prometheus metrics (holmesgpt has 'prometrix' but we need prometheus-client for direct metrics)
prometheus-client>=0.19.0

# Structured logging (HolmesGPT has colorlog, we add python-json-logger for JSON output)
python-json-logger>=2.0.7

# YAML configuration parsing (for mounted ConfigMap)
PyYAML>=6.0

# File system watching for ConfigMap hot-reload (DD-HAPI-004, BR-HAPI-199)
watchdog>=3.0.0,<4.0.0

# ========================================
# CLOUD PROVIDER SDKs - REMOVED FOR E2E
# ========================================
# These are NOT needed when MOCK_LLM_MODE=true (BR-HAPI-212)
# Mock mode returns deterministic responses without calling real LLM providers
#
# REMOVED (1.5GB):
# google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38  # Vertex AI (only needed for Vertex AI users)
#
# Note: boto3, azure-*, opensearch-py are in HolmesGPT SDK dependencies
# but not used by holmesgpt-api mock mode, so they're just wasted space in E2E
