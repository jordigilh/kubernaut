# ⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - Environment Classifier Service - Design Deep Dive

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: **DEPRECATED** - Environment Classifier Integrated into Alert Processor
**Parent**: [Service Catalog](KUBERNAUT_SERVICE_CATALOG.md)

---

## 🚨 **DEPRECATION NOTICE**

**This document is DEPRECATED and should not be used for current development.**

- **Reason**: Environment Classifier integrated as component within Alert Processor Service
- **Replacement**: See environment classification in [KUBERNAUT_SERVICE_CATALOG.md](KUBERNAUT_SERVICE_CATALOG.md) Alert Processor section
- **Current Status**: Environment classification is in-process component, not separate service
- **Last Updated**: January 2025

**⚠️ Do not use this information for architectural decisions.**

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

The Environment Classifier Service is a **critical intelligence component** that provides **cloud-native, business-driven classification** of Kubernetes namespaces by environment type (production, staging, development, testing). This service enables **accurate alert routing**, **appropriate business priority assignment**, and **compliance with organizational standards** for incident response and resource management.

### **Strategic Importance**
- **🛡️ Zero False Negatives**: >99% accuracy in production identification prevents critical incidents
- **⚡ 50% Faster Response**: Environment-aware routing reduces incident response time
- **💰 Cost Optimization**: Accurate environment classification enables proper resource allocation
- **📋 Compliance**: Automated audit trails and organizational standard validation

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture & Design Philosophy**

### **Design Principles**

#### **1. Cloud-Native First**
- **Kubernetes-Native Metadata**: Primary classification via standard Kubernetes labels and annotations
- **GitOps Integration**: Seamless integration with ArgoCD, Flux, and Helm deployments
- **Service Mesh Aware**: Integration with Istio, Linkerd for traffic-based classification
- **Observability Integration**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry metadata utilization

#### **2. Business-Driven Intelligence**
- **Organizational Alignment**: Classification rules align with business structures and processes
- **SLA-Aware Processing**: Different priorities based on business criticality and SLA requirements
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Business unit isolation and resource allocation management
- **Compliance Integration**: Automated validation against organizational standards

#### **3. Hierarchical Classification Strategy**

```

#### **4. Safety-First Design**
- **Zero False Negatives**: Production environments never misclassified as non-production
- **Confidence Scoring**: All classifications include confidence metrics
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-validation across multiple metadata sources
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability for all classification decisions

## 🎯 **Business Priority Mapping**

### **Priority Classification Matrix**
| Environment | Business Priority | SLA Target | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Production** | Critical (P0) | 99.9% availability | <5 minutes | Immediate |
| **Staging** | High (P1) | 99.5% availability | <15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **Development** | Medium (P2) | 95% availability | <1 hour | 4 hours |
| **Testing** | Low (P3) | 90% availability | <4 hours | Next business day |

### **Business Context Integration**
```yaml
Business Unit Mapping:
  platform-team:
    cost_center: "CC-ENG-001"
    escalation_policy: "platform-oncall"
    sla_requirements:
      production: "99.9%"
      staging: "99.5%"

  product-team:
    cost_center: "CC-PROD-002"
    escalation_policy: "product-oncall"
    sla_requirements:
      production: "99.95%"
      staging: "99.0%"

Compliance Requirements:

## 🔄 **Multi-Source Validation Engine**

### **Validation Architecture**
```mermaid

    participant NS as Namespace
    participant EC as Environment Classifier
    participant L as Labels Classifier
    participant A as Annotations Classifier
    participant C as ConfigMap Classifier
    participant P as Pattern Classifier
    participant V as Validator
    participant S as Scorer

    L-->>EC: Label Classification
    EC->>A: Extract Annotations
    A-->>EC: Annotation Classification
    EC->>C: Apply ConfigMap Rules

    V->>V: Conflict Resolution
    V-->>EC: Validated Classification

    EC->>S: Confidence Scoring
    S-->>EC: Final Score
    EC-->>NS: Classification Result
```

### **Conflict Resolution Strategy**
```yaml
Priority Hierarchy:
  1. Kubernetes Labels (highest confidence)
  2. Annotations (high confidence)
  3. ConfigMap Rules (medium confidence)
  4. Pattern Matching (lowest confidence)

Conflict Resolution Rules:
  - Production Override: Any source indicating production takes precedence
  - Confidence Weighting: Higher confidence sources override lower confidence
  - Multi-Source Agreement: Agreement across sources increases confidence
  - Safety Bias: When uncertain, classify as higher priority environment

Confidence Calculation:
  base_confidence = method_confidence * source_reliability
  multi_source_bonus = agreement_factor * 0.1
  safety_adjustment = production_bias * 0.05
  final_confidence = min(base_confidence + multi_source_bonus + safety_adjustment, 1.0)
```
