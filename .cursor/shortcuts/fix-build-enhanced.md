# Enhanced Fix Build Command Suggestions

## Current Implementation
âœ… **Created**: `/fix-build` command that triggers the comprehensive TDD methodology-compliant build fixing process.

## Suggested Improvements for Versatility and Natural Usage

### 1. **Context-Aware Variants**

#### Quick Fix Variant
```json
{
    "name": "Quick Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-build-quick",
    "description": "Fast build error fix for simple cases with minimal validation",
    "command": "Fix these build errors quickly but safely:\n1. Run basic lint check\n2. Identify undefined symbols\n3. Apply minimal fixes\n4. Validate build success\n\nSkip comprehensive analysis for simple import/type issues. Ask for approval only if creating new types.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "quick", "simple"]
}
```

#### Specific Component Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Component Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-build-component",
    "description": "Fix build errors for a specific component or package",
    "command": "Fix build errors for the specified component following TDD methodology:\n1. Focus analysis on the target component and its dependencies\n2. Validate integration with main applications\n3. Preserve existing functionality\n4. Ask which component to focus on if not specified",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "component", "focused"]
}
```

### 2. **Natural Language Triggers**

#### Conversational Variants
```json
{
    "name": "Fix My Build",
    "trigger": "/fix-my-build",
    "description": "Natural language trigger for build fixing",
    "command": "I'll help you fix your build errors systematically. Let me start by analyzing what's broken and then we'll fix it step by step following TDD methodology.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "natural", "conversational"]
}
```

```json
{
    "name": "Build is Broken",
    "trigger": "/build-broken",
    "description": "Emergency build fix trigger",
    "command": "Let me help fix your broken build. I'll analyze the errors comprehensively and provide options before making any changes.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "emergency", "broken"]
}
```

### 3. **Severity-Based Variants**

#### Critical Build Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Critical Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-build-critical",
    "description": "Emergency build fix with minimal methodology overhead",
    "command": "CRITICAL BUILD FIX MODE:\n1. Identify blocking errors immediately\n2. Apply minimal safe fixes\n3. Skip comprehensive analysis for obvious issues\n4. Focus on getting build working first\n5. Schedule proper methodology compliance for later\n\nUse only when build is completely broken and blocking development.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "critical", "emergency"]
}
```

#### Preventive Build Check
```json
{
    "name": "Preventive Build Check",
    "trigger": "/check-build",
    "description": "Proactive build health check before issues occur",
    "command": "Perform preventive build health check:\n1. Run comprehensive lint analysis\n2. Check for potential undefined symbols\n3. Validate all imports and dependencies\n4. Identify potential cascade failure points\n5. Suggest preventive fixes\n\nThis helps catch issues before they become build failures.",
    "category": "maintenance",
    "tags": ["build", "check", "preventive", "health"]
}
```

### 4. **Smart Context Detection**

#### Auto-Detecting Build Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Smart Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/smart-fix",
    "description": "Automatically detects build context and applies appropriate fix strategy",
    "command": "I'll analyze your current context and apply the most appropriate build fix strategy:\n\n- If simple import/type issues: Quick fix\n- If undefined symbols: Comprehensive analysis\n- If test-only issues: TDD-focused approach\n- If main app integration: Full methodology compliance\n\nLet me detect what type of build issues you're facing first.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "smart", "adaptive", "context-aware"]
}
```

### 5. **File-Specific Variants**

#### Test File Build Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Test Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-test-build",
    "description": "Fix build errors specifically in test files",
    "command": "Fix build errors in test files with TDD compliance:\n1. Validate test structure follows TDD methodology\n2. Check business logic integration\n3. Ensure proper mock usage\n4. Validate test-to-business-requirement mapping\n5. Preserve existing test patterns",
    "category": "testing",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "test", "tdd", "methodology"]
}
```

#### Main App Build Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Main App Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-main-build",
    "description": "Fix build errors in main application files",
    "command": "Fix build errors in main application with integration focus:\n1. Prioritize main application functionality\n2. Ensure business code integration\n3. Validate service startup and dependencies\n4. Check configuration loading\n5. Preserve production readiness",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "main", "application", "integration"]
}
```

### 6. **Progressive Complexity**

#### Staged Build Fix
```json
{
    "name": "Staged Build Fix",
    "trigger": "/fix-build-staged",
    "description": "Fix build errors in progressive stages with user control",
    "command": "Let's fix your build errors in stages:\n\nSTAGE 1: Quick wins (imports, obvious fixes)\nSTAGE 2: Type and function resolution\nSTAGE 3: Complex dependency issues\nSTAGE 4: Integration validation\n\nI'll complete each stage and ask if you want to continue to the next. This gives you control over the complexity level.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "staged", "progressive", "controlled"]
}
```

### 7. **Integration with Existing Commands**

#### Enhanced Command Relationships
```json
{
    "name": "Investigate and Fix Build",
    "trigger": "/investigate-fix-build",
    "description": "Combines investigation and fixing in one workflow",
    "command": "I'll investigate your build errors thoroughly and then fix them:\n\n1. First: Comprehensive analysis (like /investigate-build)\n2. Then: Present findings and options\n3. Finally: Apply fixes with your approval (like /fix-build)\n\nThis combines the best of both investigation and fixing workflows.",
    "category": "debugging",
    "tags": ["build", "error", "investigate", "fix", "comprehensive"]
}
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### A. **Most Valuable Additions**
1. **`/fix-build-quick`** - For simple, obvious fixes
2. **`/smart-fix`** - Context-aware automatic strategy selection
3. **`/fix-my-build`** - Natural language variant
4. **`/fix-build-staged`** - Progressive complexity control

### B. **Natural Usage Patterns**
- Use conversational triggers (`/fix-my-build`, `/build-broken`)
- Provide severity options (`/fix-build-critical` for emergencies)
- Allow component focus (`/fix-build-component`)
- Enable progressive fixing (`/fix-build-staged`)

### C. **Enhanced User Experience**
1. **Context Detection**: Automatically determine appropriate strategy
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
3. **Natural Language**: Use conversational triggers
4. **Escape Hatches**: Provide quick options for emergencies
5. **Staged Approach**: Allow users to control complexity level

### D. **Backward Compatibility**
- Keep original `/fix-build` as the comprehensive option
- Add variants that complement rather than replace
- Maintain methodology compliance across all variants
- Preserve safety and validation requirements

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick fix for simple issues
/fix-build-quick

# Natural language
/fix-my-build

# Emergency mode
/fix-build-critical

# Smart context-aware
/smart-fix

# Progressive control
/fix-build-staged

# Component-focused
/fix-build-component pkg/workflow/engine

# Test-specific
/fix-test-build

# Investigation + fixing
/investigate-fix-build
```

This approach provides multiple entry points while maintaining the rigorous methodology compliance that's essential for the kubernaut project.
