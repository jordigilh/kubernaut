## 📝 When to Create a New DD

Create a new DD document for decisions that:
- ✅ Affect multiple services or the overall architecture
- ✅ Have long-term implications (>6 months)
- ✅ Involve trade-offs between alternatives
- ✅ Set precedents for future decisions
- ✅ Change existing architectural patterns
